# Windows and Doors

Windows and doors are considered **fenestration**, and are primary components of the building envelope. The building envelope is the exterior shell of a building, including its walls, roof, windows, doors, and foundation. The building envelope:

*   acts as the interface between the indoor and outdoor environment
*   regulates the building's climatic response
*   should be designed to conserve energy

A well-designed building envelope:

*   maximises daylight and natural ventilation
*   provides views to the exterior
*   modulates solar heat gain
*   controls and reduces noise
*   may integrate systems for renewable energy and rainwater harvesting
*   eliminates the entry of contaminated air and moisture

### a) Windows

Many design features and technologies improve the energy efficiency, durability, aesthetics, and functionality of windows. The energy-related properties of windows are influenced by:

*   frame materials
*   glazing or glass features
*   gas fills and spacers
*   type of operation

#### Frames and Sash

Improving the thermal resistance of the frame can contribute to a window's overall energy efficiency, especially its heat loss rate or U-factor. Vinyl, wood, fiberglass, and some composite frame materials provide greater thermal resistance than metal. 

#### Types of Frames

| **Aluminium/Metal** | Very strong and light.  Almost maintenance-free. Metal or aluminium window frames conduct heat rapidly, making metal a poor insulating material. To reduce heat flow, metal frames should have a thermal break - an insulating plastic strip between the inside and outside of the frame.                                                                        | Very strong, light, and almost maintenance-free.                                                                            | Conducts heat very rapidly, making it a very poor insulating material.                                                                                                       |
| **Composite**       | Consists of composite wood products such as particleboard and laminated strand lumber. Some are mixed with polymer plastics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Very stable, with the same or better structural and thermal properties as conventional wood, and better moisture and decay resistance. | None stated in the source.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Vinyl**            | Made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with ultraviolet light (UV) stabilizers to prevent sunlight from breaking down the material.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Do not require painting and have good moisture resistance. The hollow cavities can be filled with insulation, making them thermally superior to standard vinyl and wood frames. | None stated in the source.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Fiberglass**      | Dimensionally stable and have air cavities that can be filled with insulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Superior thermal performance compared to wood or uninsulated vinyl.                                                           | None stated in the source.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Wood**            | Insulates relatively well but requires regular maintenance. Aluminium or vinyl cladding reduces maintenance. Metal-clad wood frames may have slightly lower thermal performance.                                                                                                                                                                                     | Insulates relatively well.                                                                                                   | Requires regular maintenance, although aluminium or vinyl cladding reduces maintenance requirements. Metal-clad wood frames may have slightly lower thermal performance. |

#### Types of Glass

| Glass Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Advantages                                                                                                                         | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Low-Emissivity Coatings** | Microscopically thin, virtually invisible, metal or metallic oxide layer on one or more panes of glass. Different types of low-e coatings have been designed: high, moderate or low solar gain, and tuned visible daylight transmission.                                                       | Costs 10% to 15% more than regular windows, but reduce energy loss by as much as 30% to 50%. Lowers the U-factor. | None stated in the source.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Spectrally Selective**   | Designed to be spectrally selective, filtering out 40% to 70% of the heat normally transmitted through insulated window glass or glazing while allowing the full amount of daylight.                                                                                                                          | Provides daylight and views while transmitting as little non-visible infrared radiation as possible.                                   | None stated in the source.                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Gas Fills and Spacers

To minimise heat transfer between the inside and outside of the window, the space between glazing layers (usually about 1/2") is filled with argon or krypton gas. Both are inert, non-toxic, clear, and odourless.

*   Argon is commonly used because it is inexpensive and performs well in typical 1/2" spaces.
*   Krypton is used when the space is thinner than usual (usually about 1/4"). It has better thermal performance than argon but is more expensive.

### b) Doors

#### Energy Efficient Doors

To improve the energy efficiency of doors, consider these factors:

*   Proper insulation - look for doors with high insulation values (R-values)
*   Weather-stripping and sealing - to prevent drafts and air leaks
*   Low-E glass - to reduce heat transfer
*   Multi-point locks - for better security and a tighter seal
*   Energy Star certification
*   Thresholds and sweeps - to prevent air leakage
*   Professional installation - to maximise energy efficiency

# Walls

Walls are a major component of a building's envelope and play a critical role in its thermal performance. This response will explain various sub-concepts related to walls in building envelope optimisation, highlight important points, and then present types of walls and materials in tabular structures. 

### Importance of Walls

Walls are constantly exposed to external environmental conditions like solar radiation, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Consequently, their construction significantly impacts indoor thermal comfort in naturally ventilated buildings and the cooling load in air-conditioned buildings.

**Key takeaway:** The selection of wall materials, thickness, and finishes should be based on the climate zone and the desired comfort level within the building.

### Wall Properties Influencing Heat Transfer

Several properties of a wall influence how it manages heat transfer:

*   Thermal conductivity
*   Thermal resistivity
*   Thermal absorptivity
*   Emissivity
*   Thermal reflectivity
*   Thermal capacity

### Enhancing Thermal Performance of Walls

Several strategies can be employed to improve the thermal performance of walls.

#### 1. Thermal Insulation 

*   **Purpose:** Reduces thermal conductance, thereby minimising heat gain and loss. 
*   **Placement:** Always on the hotter side of the wall.
    *   Hot climates: External side of the wall.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Controls interior mean radiant temperature (MRT) by mitigating the impact of external conditions.
    *   In conjunction with infiltration control, insulation is vital for reducing heating and cooling loads in buildings with skin-load dominance (e.g., residences). 
    *   Plays a role in reducing cooling energy consumption in internal-load dominated buildings (e.g., offices with high equipment loads). This is particularly important in hot, dry, composite, and warm humid climates.

#### Types of Insulation Materials

| Category                                        | Examples                                                                           |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rigid or semi-rigid blocks and boards           | Mineral wool, expanded polystyrene boards                                    |
| Boards with impact or weather-resistant surfaces | Suitable for exterior use                                                    |
| Loose fill                                      | Cellulose, fibreglass                                                        |
| Foam and dry spray                             | Polyurethane or polyisocyanurate                                                |
| Blankets, felts, or sheets                      | Fibreglass, mineral wool, closed-cell flexible elastomeric foam               |

**Important Considerations for Insulation:**

*   Specify key properties: thickness, density, thermal resistivity/conductivity at a specific temperature, long-term thermal retention, fire resistance, moisture resistance (open/closed cell structure), water vapour diffusion resistance.
*   Adhere to manufacturer recommendations during application to ensure the rated insulation in terms of thermal resistance or R-value is achieved.

#### 2. Thermal Mass

*   **Mechanism:** Increases the time lag between changes in external environmental conditions and their impact on internal conditions.
*   **Properties:** Thermally massive walls have a high thermal capacity, influenced by:
    *   Compactness
    *   Density 
    *   Specific heat capacity of materials
*   **Application:**
    *   Walls, roofs, and floors can serve as thermal storage.
    *   Effectiveness is enhanced by fluid flow through the storage media.
    *   Particularly effective in hot-dry climates with a significant diurnal temperature range. 
        *   Stores heat during the day and releases it to the interior at night.
        *   Can also be used to store heat during the day in cold climates for release at night. 
*   **Suitable Materials:** Concrete, brick, water
*   **Design Considerations:**
    *   Exposed storage mass should be dark-coloured to maximise absorption.
    *   Thicker mass generally provides greater efficiency.
    *   Optimal thickness typically ranges from 100 mm to 200 mm.

#### 3. Air Cavities 

*   **Effect:** Reduces the heat gain factor, especially when ventilated.
*   **Mechanism:** Heat transfer through the cavity occurs via convection and radiation. 
*   **Thickness:** Cavity resistance to heat flow is relatively constant for thicknesses exceeding 20 mm.
*   **Important Note:** Air cavities should not replace proper insulation when required by design specifications.

#### 4. Surface Finishes 

*   **Role:** Surface colour and finish significantly impact heat gain and loss.
*   **Light Colours:** Reflect solar radiation.

# Roofs and Floors

### Roofs

Roofs are constantly exposed to the external environment and can significantly impact a building's energy efficiency. In urban environments, reinforced cement concrete (RCC) is a popular roofing material, but its high thermal conductivity makes it inefficient in regulating indoor temperatures.  When exposed to solar heat, RCC roofs transfer heat into the building, increasing the demand for air conditioning. 

**Key Considerations for Roofs:**

*   **Insulation:** Insulation acts as a barrier to heat flow, minimising heat gain during the day and reducing cooling loads. It's crucial to select appropriate insulation materials and ensure proper installation for optimal performance. 
*   **Thermal Transmittance:** Minimising the overall thermal transmittance (U-value) of the roof is essential to reducing heat inflow. The recommended U-value for exposed roofs should not exceed 0.58 W/(m2°C).
*   **Solar Reflectivity:**  Using materials with high solar reflectivity can help reflect solar radiation away from the building, further reducing heat gain. Light-coloured finishes and specialised reflective coatings can enhance solar reflectivity.

### Floors

Floors are a significant component of the building envelope, especially in terms of heat loss.  Underfloor insulation plays a vital role in preventing heat loss to the ground or unheated spaces below.

**Key Considerations for Floors:**

*   **Underfloor Insulation:**  Installing insulation beneath the floor creates a barrier against cold air infiltration from the ground or unheated spaces. This helps maintain comfortable indoor temperatures and reduces heating costs.
*   **Insulation Materials:** Choosing appropriate insulation materials is crucial for effective underfloor insulation. Common options include rigid foam boards and batt insulation, which offer good thermal resistance.
*   **Lightweight Concrete:** Utilising lightweight concrete for floor levelling can contribute to insulation. Preformed foam concrete, for example, offers good thermal properties and can be used as a filler in floor cavities.
