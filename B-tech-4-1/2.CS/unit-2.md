# How criminals plan the attacks

Criminals meticulously plan cyberattacks, employing a range of techniques to exploit system vulnerabilities and achieve their objectives. These attacks can be broadly categorized into several distinct phases:

### 1. Reconnaissance 

This initial stage, also known as **information gathering**, is crucial for attackers to gain a comprehensive understanding of their target. It is considered a **passive attack** as it involves gathering information without the target's knowledge. Reconnaissance serves as a foundation for subsequent stages of the attack.

### 1.1 Footprinting

A critical aspect of reconnaissance is **footprinting**, which involves accumulating data about the target's environment and computer architecture. This information helps attackers identify potential entry points and vulnerabilities that can be exploited later in the attack.

### 1.2 Passive Attacks

Passive attacks are employed to gather information discreetly, without raising any alarms. Criminals often leverage internet resources for this purpose. Common tactics include:

*   **Search engine queries:** Utilising search engines like Google or Yahoo to discover information about employees or the target organization.
*   **Social media reconnaissance:** Scouring social media platforms like Orkut and Facebook to gather personal details and insights into individuals' lives.
*   **Website analysis:** Examining the target organization's website for information about key personnel, contact details, and organizational structure.
*   **Open-source intelligence (OSINT):** Exploiting publicly available information from sources like blogs, newsgroups, press releases, and job postings to glean insights into the target's operations, technologies, and potential weaknesses.

### 1.3 Active Attacks

Active attacks, unlike their passive counterparts, involve direct interaction with the target's systems. While they carry a higher risk of detection, active attacks yield more precise information about vulnerabilities and security measures in place. Some frequently used tools and techniques for active attacks include:

*   **Port scanning:** Identifying open ports on a system, which can be exploited to gain access or launch further attacks. Tools like Nmap are commonly used for this purpose.
*   **Network scanning:** Mapping the target network to understand IP addresses, network topology, and interconnected systems.
*   **Vulnerability scanning:** Probing systems for known weaknesses using tools like Nessus. This helps attackers identify specific vulnerabilities that they can exploit.

### 1.4 Scanning/Scrutinizing

Once information has been gathered through passive and active means, criminals meticulously analyze it to pinpoint potential attack vectors and plan their next steps.

### 1.5 Enumeration

A key part of this phase is **enumeration**, which aims to identify valid user accounts, network resources, and applications running on the target system. This information can be used to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and carry out malicious activities.

### 1.6 Attack (Gaining & Maintaining System Access)

This phase marks the culmination of the attacker's efforts. Having identified vulnerabilities and gathered necessary information, criminals launch their attack, aiming to:

*   **Crack passwords:** Using techniques like brute-force attacks or exploiting weak password practices.
*   **Exploit privileges:** Leveraging system vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain elevated access and control.
*   **Execute malicious commands/applications:** Deploying malware, stealing data, or disrupting services.
*   **Hide files:** Concealing evidence of their intrusion to avoid detection.
*   **Cover tracks:** Deleting access logs and other traces of their activity to maintain their access and hinder forensic investigations.

It's important to note that this is a simplified representation of how criminals plan cyberattacks. The sophistication and complexity of these attacks can vary greatly depending on the attacker's skill, resources, and motivation. Attackers constantly evolve their tactics and tools to circumvent security measures, making it crucial for individuals and organizations to stay vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity posture.

# Social Engineering: Classification of Social Engineering

### Classifications of Social Engineering

Social engineering is a manipulation technique used to trick people into divulging confidential information or granting unauthorized access. It preys on human psychology, exploiting trust, helpfulness, and fear to achieve its aims. Social engineering can be broadly classified as:

#### Human-Based Social Engineering

This type of social engineering hinges on **direct person-to-person interaction**. Attackers leverage their social skills to build rapport, gain trust, and extract valuable information or manipulate their victims into performing actions that compromise security. The sources outline several methods employed in human-based social engineering:

*   **Impersonation:** Attackers might pose as legitimate employees, IT support personnel, or trusted third parties to deceive victims into revealing sensitive information or granting access. This plays on people's willingness to help and their deference to authority.
*   **Posing as an important user:** Attackers may impersonate high-ranking officials, executives, or individuals with significant authority within an organization. They exploit the reluctance of lower-level employees to question or challenge those in positions of power, gaining access to restricted systems or information.
*   **Using a third person:** Attackers may pretend to have authorization from a legitimate source to access systems or information, using the name of a colleague, supervisor, or external contact to lend credibility to their request.
*   **Calling technical support:** Attackers often target help desks and technical support personnel, as they are trained to assist users and may unknowingly reveal sensitive information or provide assistance that enables unauthorized access.
*   **Shoulder surfing:** This technique involves discreetly observing individuals as they enter passwords, PINs, or other sensitive information, often in public places like ATMs or computer terminals.
*   **Dumpster diving:** Attackers may rummage through trash bins to retrieve discarded documents containing confidential information, such as passwords, account numbers, or internal communications.

#### Computer-Based Social Engineering

This form of social engineering relies on **technology and online platforms** to deceive victims. Attackers leverage various techniques to trick users into revealing sensitive information, installing malware, or granting unauthorized access:

*   **Fake emails:** Attackers craft deceptive emails that appear to originate from legitimate sources, such as banks, online retailers, or service providers. These emails often include links to fraudulent websites or attachments containing malware, aiming to steal login credentials, financial information, or other sensitive data. This technique is commonly referred to as "phishing".
*   **Email attachments:** Attackers embed malicious code into seemingly harmless attachments, such as documents or images. When opened, these attachments can install malware, granting attackers control over the victim's system or enabling them to steal data.
*   **Pop-up windows:** Deceptive pop-up windows, often disguised as legitimate security alerts or software updates, can trick users into installing malware, providing personal information, or granting access to their systems.

It is crucial to note that social engineering tactics are continually evolving. Attackers constantly adapt their methods to exploit new technologies and vulnerabilities, making it essential for individuals and organizations to remain vigilant, exercise caution, and stay informed about emerging threats.

# Cyberstalking

### Cyberstalking Explained

#### 1. Types of Stalkers

The sources describe two main types of stalkers: **online stalkers** and **offline stalkers**.

*   **Online stalkers** directly engage with the victim using the internet.  They often use email and chat rooms as their preferred communication channels. Online stalkers often aim to make their presence known to the victim and may even use a third party to harass them.
*   **Offline stalkers** may start their attack using traditional methods such as following the victim or observing their daily routine. They can also use the internet for information gathering by searching message boards, personal websites, and people-finding services.  Unlike online stalkers, offline stalkers try to stay undetected by the victim. 

#### 2. Working of Stalking

Stalking often follows a pattern that involves several key steps:

*   **Information Gathering:** The stalker collects personal information about the victim, including their name, family background, contact details (phone numbers, email address, home and office addresses), date of birth, and more.
*   **Contact:** The stalker establishes contact with the victim, often starting with phone calls or emails. Phone calls may be used for threats or harassment, while emails may range from loving to threatening or sexually explicit in nature. The stalker might use multiple names to conceal their identity.
*   **Harassment:** The stalker continues to contact the victim, sending repeated emails asking for favours or issuing threats.
*   **Public Humiliation:** The stalker may post the victim's personal information on websites related to illicit services, falsely portraying the victim as someone seeking such services. They might use offensive or attractive language to entice people to contact the victim.
*   **Further Harassment:** Individuals who come across the posted information may contact the victim, seeking sexual services or relationships.
*   **Unsolicited Content:** The stalker may subscribe the victim's email address to pornographic and sex websites, resulting in the victim receiving unwanted emails.

#### 3. Real-Life Incident of Cyberstalking

The sources provide a real-life example of cyberstalking reported in Delhi, India. A woman (Mrs. Joshi in the example) received numerous phone calls, mostly at odd hours, from various locations across the country.  The harassment disrupted her personal life and caused significant distress, leading her to file a police complaint. Upon investigation, it was discovered that someone had been using her online identity on the website www.mirc.com. The perpetrator used her name and address while engaging in online chats and even shared her phone number with other users, encouraging them to contact her. This was the first officially registered case of cyberstalking in Delhi.

This incident highlights the severe consequences of cyberstalking and emphasizes the importance of online safety and awareness.

# Botnets: The Fuel for Cybercrime

### Botnets Explained

The sources explain that a **botnet** is a network of computers called **zombies**, which have been infected with malicious software and are controlled by an attacker. The malware allows the attacker to remotely control the infected computers without the users' knowledge. The attacker who controls the botnet is called the **botmaster**. 

#### What is a Bot?

The word **bot** is short for robot. A bot is simply an automated computer program. Your computer can become part of a botnet if it is infected with a virus or other malicious code that allows outside access.   A computer that is part of a botnet may still appear to be working normally. 

**Bots** can be characterised by:

*   Remote control and communication channels used to command the victim computer.
*   The types of remote commands that are implemented.
*   The mechanisms used to spread the bot further.

**Command & Control (C&C) channels** are used by the botmaster to send commands and information to the zombies and to receive information back from them.  Common protocols used for C&C channels include:

*   Internet Relay Chat (IRC).
*   HTTP.
*   Overnet (Kademlia).

The communication topology of a botnet is often implied by the protocols that are used.

#### How Botnets are Built

Building a botnet involves three stages:

1.  **Prepare and Expose:** The attacker identifies a vulnerability that can be exploited to introduce malware onto the user's device. This could involve exploiting a website vulnerability, taking advantage of human behaviour, or finding a flaw in an application. The attacker sets up a trap to lure the target into becoming exposed to the malware, either knowingly or unknowingly.
2.  **Infecting the User via Malware:** Once the vulnerability is identified, the attacker activates the malware to infect the user's device and compromise its security. This is commonly achieved using Trojan viruses or social engineering techniques. Some attackers use a more aggressive approach known as a drive-by download attack to infect the device.
3.  **Controlling the Targeted Devices:** The final stage involves establishing control over all infected devices. The attacker organises the infected machines into a botnet and establishes a system for managing them remotely. Thousands of devices can be controlled in this way through a vast zombie network. Upon successful completion of this stage, the attacker gains administrator-like access to the targeted devices or computers. This allows the attacker to read and write data on the system, capture personal information, share data from the device, monitor all activities on the device, and search for further vulnerabilities.

#### Botnet Architectures

The sources describe two main approaches to controlling the infected bots in a botnet:

*   **Client-server botnets:** In this traditional model, a central command and control (C&C) server is set up. The attacker sends automated commands to infected clients through a communication protocol such as IRC. The bots are programmed to remain dormant and await commands from the C&C server before carrying out any malicious activities.
*   **Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets:** This approach is more decentralised. Instead of relying on a central C&C server, infected devices scan for malicious websites or other devices that are part of the same botnet. Bots can then share updated commands or new versions of the malware with each other. P2P botnets are more difficult for security vendors and law enforcement to detect and disrupt because they do not rely on easily identifiable C&C communications.

#### How Botnets are Used

Malware is currently the major source of attacks and fraudulent activities on the Internet. Botnets have become a source of income for cybercriminals. They are used to conduct a variety of malicious activities, including:

*   **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks:** A botnet can be used to flood a target server with traffic, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users. 
*   **Spamming:** Botnets can be used to send vast amounts of unsolicited email, often for phishing scams or to spread malware. 
*   **Malware Distribution:** Botnets can be used to distribute malware to other computers, expanding the botnet's reach and enabling further attacks.
*   **Data Theft:** Botnets can be used to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial data, and personal information.

#### Protecting Your Computer from Botnets

The sources offer some tips for protecting your computer from botnets:

*   **Keep your operating system updated:** Regularly install security updates for your operating system and applications to patch known vulnerabilities. 
*   **Download from trusted resources:** Download software only from trusted sources, such as official websites or reputable app stores.
*   **Avoid suspicious links:** Be cautious about clicking on links in emails, social media messages, or on websites, especially if they seem suspicious.
*   **Pay attention to website security:** Look for websites that use HTTPS, which indicates a secure connection.
*   **Avoid P2P downloads:** Be cautious about downloading files from peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, as these can be sources of malware.
*   **Change login details when introducing new devices:** If you connect a new device to your network, change your passwords for sensitive accounts as a precaution.
*   **Use a firewall:** A firewall can help block unauthorized access to your computer.
*   **Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA):** Strong passwords and 2FA can make it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your accounts.
*   **Deploy antivirus software:** Install reputable antivirus software and keep it updated.

By following these recommendations and staying informed about cybersecurity threats, you can significantly reduce your risk of becoming a victim of botnet attacks.

# Attack Vector

### What is an Attack Vector?

An **attack vector** is a pathway or method that attackers use to gain unauthorised access to a computer system or network. The sources explain that attack vectors can exploit vulnerabilities in a system, including weaknesses in technology, software, or human behaviour. Attack vectors allow attackers to gain a foothold in a system, potentially leading to a range of malicious activities such as data theft, malware installation, or system disruption. 

The sources provide many examples of common attack vectors, including:

*   **Phishing:** Phishing attacks trick users into revealing sensitive information, like passwords or credit card details, by disguising themselves as trustworthy entities. For example, an attacker might send an email that appears to be from a legitimate bank, asking the user to click a link and verify their account information. In reality, the link leads to a fake website controlled by the attacker, who can then steal the entered credentials.
*   **Email Attachments:** Email attachments can contain malicious code that executes when the user opens the file. This code could be a virus, worm, or Trojan horse that can infect the user's computer and allow the attacker to take control.
*   **Vishing:** Vishing (voice phishing) is a type of social engineering attack that uses phone calls to trick victims into revealing sensitive information. Attackers often spoof their caller ID to make it appear as if the call is coming from a legitimate source. They may impersonate authority figures, technicians, or even fellow employees to gain the victim's trust and convince them to divulge confidential information.
*   **Mishing:** Similar to phishing, mishing uses text messages (SMS) to deceive victims into clicking malicious links or providing personal information. Mishing messages often contain misspellings or grammatical errors, which can ironically make them appear more authentic, as attackers exploit the perception that legitimate sources would have perfect grammar.
*   **Smishing:** Smishing is another form of phishing that uses SMS messages. Smishing attacks often impersonate legitimate organisations like banks or shipping companies, using urgent messages to create a sense of panic and trick victims into taking immediate action, such as clicking a malicious link or providing personal information.
*   **Bluetooth Hacking:** The increasing popularity of Bluetooth-enabled devices has made them targets for attackers. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in Bluetooth technology to gain unauthorised access to devices and steal information or take control. 
    *   **BlueBorne:** This attack vector exploits vulnerabilities in Bluetooth to spread malware through the air.  A device does not need to be paired with the attacker's device for it to be compromised.
    *   **Bluesnarfing:** In a bluesnarfing attack, the attacker pairs with the user's device without their knowledge and steals personal data. Attackers may use tools like "bluediving" to scan for vulnerable devices and exploit known weaknesses to gain access. 
    *   **Bluebugging:** Bluebugging attacks take advantage of the "discoverable" mode setting in many Bluetooth devices. With the device in discoverable mode, attackers can establish a connection and potentially gain full control, enabling them to listen to calls, read and send messages, and steal contacts.

**Signs of an Attack**

The sources list several indicators that a device might be compromised, suggesting possible attack vectors:

*   **Unrecognised software installations.**
*   **Unexplained text messages or purchases.**
*   **Suspicious phone calls.**
*   **Slow device performance and increased battery drain.**
*   **Data usage spikes without changes in usage habits.**
*   **Apps malfunctioning, crashing, or failing to load.**
*   **Frequent pop-ups appearing on the screen.**

#### Attack Vector Mitigation

The sources emphasise that while no system is completely immune to attack vectors, employing multiple layers of security can effectively reduce the risk of compromise. Some strategies include:

*   **Software Updates:** Regularly update operating systems and applications to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Firewalls:** Firewalls can act as barriers between your device and the outside world, blocking unauthorised access attempts.
*   **Antivirus Software:** Install and keep your antivirus software updated to detect and remove known malware threats.
*   **Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication:**  Strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA) make it significantly harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts.
*   **User Education:** Training users to recognise and avoid potential attack vectors, such as phishing emails or suspicious links, is crucial in preventing successful attacks.

Understanding and mitigating attack vectors is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of computer systems and networks.  By implementing the security measures described in the sources and promoting cybersecurity awareness, users and organisations can strengthen their defenses against evolving attack vectors.

Cloud computing has become increasingly popular because it offers numerous advantages over traditional IT infrastructure. The sources explain that cloud computing offers the following benefits:

*   **Accessibility:** Cloud computing enables users to access applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection, eliminating the need to be tied to a specific physical location or device.
*   **Reduced Hardware Costs:** With cloud computing, organisations can reduce their reliance on expensive hardware investments. Instead of purchasing and maintaining their own servers and storage devices, they can leverage the provider's infrastructure and pay only for the resources they use. 
*   **Software Licensing Flexibility:** Cloud computing can reduce the cost of software licensing. Rather than purchasing individual software licenses for each employee, organisations can subscribe to cloud-based software services and pay a metered fee. 
*   **Space Savings:** Cloud computing eliminates the need for physical space to house servers and databases. Organisations can leverage the provider's data centres, freeing up valuable physical space for other purposes.
*   **Reduced IT Support Costs:** By relying on the cloud provider's expertise and infrastructure, organisations can potentially save on IT support costs. Instead of managing and maintaining their own systems, they can rely on the provider's support services.

#### Types of Cloud Computing Services

The sources outline three primary types of cloud computing services:

*   **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** IaaS providers, like Amazon Web Services, offer virtual servers, storage, and networking resources on demand. Customers have control over their virtual servers and can configure them to meet their specific needs, but the provider manages the underlying physical infrastructure. IaaS allows organisations to scale their IT resources up or down as needed, paying only for the resources they consume.
*   **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** PaaS provides a complete platform for developing, testing, deploying, and managing applications. The provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, networking, and operating systems, allowing developers to focus solely on building and deploying their applications. PaaS solutions often include tools and services for development, collaboration, and application lifecycle management.  **Note:** The sources caution that there are currently no interoperability standards for PaaS, which means applications developed for one PaaS platform may not be easily migrated to another.
*   **Software as a Service (SaaS):** SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access the software through a web browser or a dedicated application, and the provider manages all aspects of the application, including infrastructure, security, and updates. Popular examples of SaaS include email services like Gmail, customer relationship management (CRM) software like Salesforce, and office productivity suites like Microsoft 365.

#### Cybercrime and Cloud Computing

While cloud computing offers numerous advantages, it also introduces new security challenges. The sources highlight several key concerns related to cybercrime and cloud computing:

*   **Elevated User Access:** Outsourcing data storage and processing to a third-party provider introduces inherent risks, as cloud services may bypass an organisation's usual physical, logical, and personnel security controls. Privileged administrators at the cloud provider may have elevated access to sensitive data, raising concerns about potential misuse or insider threats.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Organisations may face challenges ensuring compliance with industry regulations and data privacy laws when utilising cloud services. It is crucial to thoroughly vet cloud providers and ensure they adhere to relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe.
*   **Data Location:** Organisations may not have full visibility into the physical location of their data when using cloud services. This can raise concerns about data sovereignty and compliance with local laws and regulations, particularly if data is stored in countries with different data protection standards.
*   **Data Segregation:** Ensuring the secure segregation of an organisation's data from data belonging to other customers sharing the same cloud infrastructure is crucial. Strong encryption mechanisms and appropriate access controls are essential to prevent unauthorised access or data leakage.
*   **Data Recovery:** Organisations must consider the implications of data recovery in the event of a disaster or service disruption. It is essential to ensure that cloud providers have robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place to minimise data loss and downtime. 
*   **Information Security Violation Reports:** The complexity of cloud environments can make it challenging to trace and investigate information security violations. Organisations should establish clear contractual obligations with cloud providers regarding the provision of security logs and incident reporting, enabling timely detection and response to security incidents.
*   **Long-Term Viability:** Organisations should consider the long-term viability of cloud providers, particularly in the event of mergers, acquisitions, or other major business changes. It is crucial to have clear exit strategies and data retrieval plans in place to minimise disruption if a cloud provider's services become unavailable or undergo significant changes. 

The sources emphasise that customers should diligently assess the security practices and track record of cloud providers before entrusting them with sensitive data. They recommend that customers negotiate strong contracts with providers that address their specific security and compliance requirements. 

By understanding the security risks associated with cloud computing and implementing appropriate security measures, organisations can leverage the benefits of cloud services while minimising their exposure to cybercrime.
