Develop a Java application to generate Electricity bill. Create a class with the following 
members: Consumer no., consumer name, previous month reading, current month reading, 
and type of EB connection (i.e. domestic or commercial). Compute the bill amount using the 
following tariff. [CO1]

2. 101-200units - Rs. 2.50 per unit
3. 201 -500 units - Rs. 4 per unit
4. >501 units - Rs. 6 per unit
If the type of the EB connection is commercial, calculate the amount to be paid as follows:
5. First 100 units - Rs. 2 per unit
6. 101-200units - Rs. 4.50 per unit
7. 201 -500 units - Rs. 6 per unit
8. >501 units - Rs. 7 per unit
