## Definition of Linear Programming (LP)

Linear Programming (LP) is a mathematical technique used to determine the optimal solution to problems where limited resources must be allocated among competing activities. This technique is widely applicable in various fields like business, government, and industry.

### Key Properties of LP Models

*   **Linearity:** The relationships between variables and constraints are linear. This means that changes in one variable will have a proportional impact on another.
*   **Objective Function:** A well-defined function, expressed as a linear equation, that needs to be either maximized (e.g., profits) or minimized (e.g., costs).
*   **Structural Constraints:** Limitations on resource usage, represented as linear equations or inequalities, that restrict the degree to which the objective can be achieved.
*   **Non-Negativity Constraint:** All variables must be non-negative (greater than or equal to zero), reflecting real-world scenarios where negative values are generally not meaningful.

### Assumptions of LP Models

*   **Deterministic Conditions:** The model assumes complete certainty regarding the values of variables and constraints.
*   **Divisibility:** Decision variables can take on fractional values, implying that resources can be divided into smaller units.
*   **Additivity:** The total contribution of all activities is the sum of the contributions of individual activities.
*   **Constant Profit/Cost and Technology:** Profit or cost per unit and production technology are assumed to remain constant throughout the planning period.
*   **Finite Choices and Resources:** The model considers a limited number of choices and resources.

### Advantages of LP

LP offers numerous advantages for decision-making:

*   **Optimal Resource Allocation:** It assists in efficiently allocating limited resources among competing activities to achieve the best possible outcome.
*   **Quantitative Basis for Decisions:** It provides a structured framework for analyzing and making informed decisions based on quantitative data.
*   **Versatility:**  LP can be applied to a broad range of problems encountered in various sectors, including production, finance, marketing, and more.

### Limitations of LP

Despite its benefits, LP has certain limitations:

*   **Linearity Assumption:**  In real-world situations, relationships between variables and constraints might not always be perfectly linear.
*   **Deterministic Nature:** It does not inherently account for uncertainty or probabilistic elements in the problem data.
*   **Single Objective:** LP models are designed to optimize a single objective function, whereas real-world problems often involve multiple objectives.

### Applications of LP

LP finds applications in various areas:

*   **Product Mix Optimization:** Determining the optimal combination of products to manufacture to maximize profit while considering resource constraints.
*   **Transportation Scheduling:**  Developing cost-effective transportation routes and schedules for distributing goods from multiple sources to multiple destinations.
*   **Assignment Problems:** Allocating tasks to individuals or machines in the most efficient way to minimize time or cost.

### Relationship with Other Models

*   **Transportation Model:** A specific type of LP problem focused on minimizing transportation costs.
*   **Assignment Model:** A special case of the transportation model that involves allocating one task to one resource only.
*   **Non-Linear Programming:** Addresses problems where the objective function or constraints are non-linear.

### Solution Methods for LP

Several methods are available to solve LP problems:

*   **Graphical Method:** Suitable for problems with two decision variables, it involves plotting constraints and visually identifying the optimal solution.
*   **Simplex Method:** A widely used iterative algorithm for solving LP problems with more than two decision variables.
*   **Dual Simplex Method:** A variant of the Simplex method, often used when the initial solution is infeasible but optimal.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:**  Examines how changes in problem parameters affect the optimal solution, providing insights into the robustness of the solution.

Linear programming is a valuable tool for making informed decisions in various situations, particularly when resource allocation and optimization are crucial. However, it is essential to be mindful of its assumptions and limitations when applying it to real-world problems.
