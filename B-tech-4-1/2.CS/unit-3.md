# Proliferation of Mobile and Wireless Devices

### The Ever-Growing Popularity of Mobile Devices

Mobile devices, including personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptops, and mobile phones, have become incredibly common in recent years. The falling prices and ever-increasing power of these devices have made them far more accessible to more people than ever before. **The increased usage of mobile devices has also brought an increase in cyber security threats**, particularly outside of the office environment. This has created significant challenges for information technology departments to properly secure these devices and protect both personal and corporate data.

There is a rapidly growing range of mobile devices available, and the capabilities of these devices continue to increase. Some of the more common types include: 

*   **Portable Computers**: These general-purpose computers can be transported but require set up and an AC power source and are therefore not practical to use while in transit.
*   **Tablet PCs**: Lacking a keyboard, and resembling a notebook in shape, these computers feature a touchscreen, stylus, and handwriting recognition software. While they can perform most tasks that a laptop can, they are not well suited for applications that require typing.
*   **Internet Tablets**: These tablet computers function more as internet appliances and lack the power and wide range of applications of tablet PCs. 
*   **PDAs**: Small, typically pocket-sized computers with limited functionality, they are commonly used to synchronize data with a desktop computer, and to access information such as contacts, notes, emails, and other features. 
*   **Ultramobile PCs**: These small but full-featured computers run a general-purpose operating system. 
*   **Smartphones**: Combining the capabilities of a PDA with integrated cell phone functionality, smartphones are a popular choice due to their wide range of features and applications.
*   **Carputers**: Installed in automobiles, these computers offer a wide range of features, including wireless computer functions, sound systems, DVD players, GPS navigation, and Bluetooth compatibility.
*   **Fly Fusion Pentop Computers**: Resembling a pen in both size and shape, these computers function as a writing tool, MP3 Player, and calculator.

While **"wireless" is a subset of "mobile"**, it is important to note the distinction between mobile computing and wireless computing. Mobile computing can be used to describe any computing device that isn't restricted to a desktop. While many mobile devices feature wireless capabilities, mobile computing can occur without wireless communication. For example, laser technology is used for wireless data transfer between buildings, but cannot be used for mobile communication. 

The trend towards mobile computing is showing no signs of slowing down. Third generation (3G) mobile technology is becoming increasingly popular, offering users greater variety in applications, better usability, and faster networking speeds. **Apple's iPhone and Google's Android operating systems are prime examples of this trend**. The increasing popularity of 3G technology has unfortunately been accompanied by a growing number of cyber security threats, as **hackers and crackers are among its biggest fans**.

The sources identify a number of factors that are contributing to the increase in cyber security outbreaks on mobile devices, including:
    *   **Enough Target Terminals:** The more widespread the use of a particular type of device, the more likely it is to be targeted by cyber criminals. The first Palm OS virus, for example, only appeared after the number of Palm OS devices reached 15 million.
    *   **Enough Functionality:** As the functionality of mobile devices continues to expand, they become more attractive targets for malware.
    *   **Enough Connectivity:** Smartphones offer a wide range of communication options, such as Bluetooth, SMS, MMS, and WLAN connections. These connection options, while useful, can also provide cyber criminals with more opportunities to spread malware.

*   **The Importance of Physical Security:** The sources also highlight the importance of physical security for protecting mobile devices and the data stored on them. They note that lost and stolen devices are becoming an increasingly serious security threat to corporations. This is particularly true for laptops, as they often contain large amounts of sensitive data, such as credit card information and social security numbers. The sources offer a number of recommendations for organisations to improve the physical security of their employees' laptops, including:
    *   **Using Cables and Hardwired Locks:** Physical locks and cables can be used to secure laptops to desks and other fixed objects, making them more difficult to steal.
    *   **Using Laptop Safes:** Laptop safes can be used to store laptops when they are not in use, making them more difficult for thieves to access.
    *   **Using Motion Sensors and Alarms:** These devices can be used to deter theft and to help track down stolen laptops.

*   **A Growing Need for User Awareness:** The sources repeatedly emphasise the need for improved user awareness and education about the cyber security threats associated with mobile devices. They suggest that many users fail to take basic security precautions, such as installing anti-virus software or using strong passwords. This is particularly true for younger workers, who often have a less developed understanding of cyber security risks. To address this issue, the sources recommend that organizations implement comprehensive security awareness training programs for all employees who use mobile devices. These training programs should cover topics such as:
    *   **Password Security:** Employees should be instructed to use strong passwords and to change them regularly. 
    *   **Data Encryption:** Employees should be encouraged to encrypt sensitive data stored on their mobile devices.
    *   **Safe Browsing Habits:** Employees should be taught how to identify and avoid phishing scams and other online threats. 
    *   **Software Updates:** Employees should be instructed to keep their mobile devices' operating systems and applications up to date, as this can help to patch security vulnerabilities.

# Credit Card Frauds in Mobile and Wireless Computing Era

### A Modern Menace: Credit Card Fraud in the Mobile Age

The sources offer insight into the methods used by criminals to commit credit card fraud, and highlight how the growing popularity of mobile devices is contributing to the problem.

#### 1. Credit Card Frauds in Mobile and Wireless Computing Era

Mobile and wireless devices have created new opportunities for criminals to commit credit card fraud. The sources explain that the ever-increasing power and falling prices of these devices has made them more accessible. **Mobile credit card transactions are becoming very common**, as new technologies are allowing people to process credit cards electronically from almost anywhere. These technologies often combine low-cost mobile phones with the capabilities of a point-of-sale (POS) terminal. 

The rise of "mobile computing," which the sources describe as anytime, anywhere computing, is further contributing to the problem. This shift in how people are working, fueled by developments in wireless technology, is affecting credit card processing as well. **Wireless credit card processing is a relatively new service that is making it easier for criminals to commit fraud**.

#### 2. Types and Techniques of Credit Card Frauds

The sources outline a number of methods used to commit credit card fraud, which fall into two main categories:

*   **Traditional Techniques:**
    *   **Paper-based application fraud** is the first and most traditional type of credit card fraud. Criminals use stolen or fake documents, such as utility bills and bank statements, to build up enough Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to open an account in someone else's name. This type of fraud can be further divided into:
        *   **ID Theft:** Where an individual pretends to be someone else.
        *   **Financial Fraud:** Where an individual provides false information about their financial status to acquire credit.
    *   **Illegal use of lost or stolen cards** is another traditional technique. Criminals may steal physical credit cards by pickpocketing or by intercepting cards from the postal service before they reach their intended recipient.
*   **Modern Techniques:**
    *   **Triangulation** is a method that involves criminals setting up fake websites that offer goods at heavily discounted prices.  When a customer places an order on the site and provides their credit card information, the criminal uses the stolen details to order the same goods from a legitimate website and have them shipped to the customer's address. This allows the criminal to receive the goods without having to use their own money, while the customer remains unaware that they have been defrauded. These fake websites are usually only available for a few weeks or months, until authorities are able to track them down. The criminals will then close the site and start a new one, making them difficult to catch. This approach is often used to create a great deal of confusion for authorities and to make it harder to trace the criminals.
    *   **Credit Card Generators** are a modern technique that uses computer emulation software to create valid credit card numbers and expiry dates. The criminals rely on these generators to create fake credit cards, which can then be used to make fraudulent purchases. The software used for this purpose is readily available online, often for free.
    *   **Skimming** is a method that involves copying information from the magnetic strip on the back of a credit card or from the data stored on a smart chip. This information can then be used to create a duplicate card or to make fraudulent purchases online.

The sources explain that criminals are also using a number of other techniques to commit credit card fraud, such as **site cloning** and **phishing**. These methods involve creating fake websites that resemble legitimate websites, in order to trick users into providing their credit card information. 

The sources note that there are a number of ways that individuals can protect themselves from credit card fraud, including:

*   **Being wary of websites that offer deals that seem too good to be true**. 
*   **Being careful about who they give their credit card information to**.
*   **Regularly checking their bank statements for any suspicious activity**.

Overall, the sources make it clear that **credit card fraud is a serious and growing problem in the mobile and wireless computing era**. Individuals and organisations need to be aware of the methods used by criminals and take steps to protect themselves.

# Security Challenges Posed by Mobile Devices 

### A Wide Range of Security Threats

The sources identify a number of security challenges posed by the use of mobile devices. 

*   **Data Security Outside the Controlled Environment:** The sources explain that mobility brings two main security challenges: data is being taken outside of the physically controlled environment of the office, and remote access back to this protected environment is often being granted. As the number of mobile users increases, the sources characterise these security challenges as "micro challenges" at the device level and "macro challenges" at the organisational level.

*   **Types of Attacks:** The sources describe a number of attack types that are commonly used to target mobile devices, including:
    *   **Malware, Viruses, and Worms:** The sources note that malware attacks are becoming more common as the use of 3G mobile technology grows. Many mobile users lack awareness of the security threats associated with mobile devices, and a growing need exists to educate them about the risks. The sources provide examples of malware specific to mobile devices, including:
        *   **Skull Trojan:** Targets Series 60 phones equipped with the Symbian mobile OS.
        *   **Cabir Worm:** The first dedicated mobile-phone worm; it infects phones running on Symbian OS and uses Bluetooth to send copies of itself to nearby vulnerable devices. The source code for this worm is publicly available online. 
        *   **Mosquito Trojan:** Affects Series 60 smartphones and is a cracked version of the "Mosquitos" mobile phone game.
        *   **Brado**r **Trojan:** Affects Windows CE OS by creating a *svchost.exe* file in the Windows startup folder, allowing full control of the device. The trojan spreads through traditional worm propagation vectors like email attachments.
        *   **Lasco Worm:** First released in 2005, it targets PDAs and mobile phones running Symbian OS and spreads via Bluetooth. It is based on the Cabir worm's source code.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** DoS attacks are designed to prevent legitimate users from accessing a system or service. The sources explain that the most common cyber security threat to wired internet service providers (ISPs) is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. These attacks flood the target system with data, either slowing down or stopping the response.
    *   **Overbilling Attacks:** This attack involves an attacker hijacking a subscriber's IP address and using the connection to initiate non-free downloads, or to simply use the connection for their own purposes. The legitimate subscriber is then billed for activity that they did not conduct or authorise.
    *   **Spoofed Policy Development Process (PDP) Attacks:** These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol (GTP).
    *   **Signaling-Level Attacks:** The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol used in IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) networks to provide Voice over IP (VoIP) services. Attackers can exploit several vulnerabilities that exist in SIP-based VoIP systems. 
    *   **Push Attacks:** The sources describe this attack as a method of remotely installing malware on a device. A push attack often uses bot networks (e.g., using a worm or zombie) to flood an enterprise server, leading to a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
    *   **Pull Attacks:** This attack involves scanning for open ports on a mobile device, then copying files from the device, potentially including user credentials, emails, and passwords. The sources illustrate this attack using the example of a rogue peer scanning a Pocket PC for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Crash Attacks:** This attack involves an attacker using different methods to send malicious code to a Pocket PC, with the aim of causing a hard reset and making the user lose access to their programs, files, and passwords. These attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in HTTP response files, infrared (IR) ports, and random IP packets.

*   **Physical Security:** Lost and stolen devices are a growing security risk to corporations, as they may contain sensitive data and provide wireless access to a corporate network. The sources explain that, although the mobile devices themselves may not be inherently valuable, losing the data they contain can put a company at serious risk.
*   **Unconventional Storage Devices:** As technology advances, storage devices continue to shrink in size, and new shapes and sizes are emerging. The sources refer to these devices as "unconventional/stealth storage devices" and explain that they pose a challenge to organisational security because they are difficult to detect and can easily be used to conceal sensitive data. These devices include compact disks (CDs), Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives (also called zip drives or memory sticks), pinhole cameras, and small digital cameras. 
*   **Lack of User Awareness:** The sources explain that many users do not have an adequate understanding of cyber security best practices. For example, they may not be aware of the risks associated with connecting to unsecured Wi-Fi networks or downloading software from untrusted sources. This lack of awareness can make mobile devices more vulnerable to attack. 

*   **Registry Settings and Configurations:** The sources use the example of Microsoft ActiveSync to demonstrate the importance of properly managing registry settings and configurations for mobile devices. ActiveSync synchronises data between Windows-powered PCs, Microsoft Outlook, and Windows mobile-powered devices. The sources explain that ensuring appropriate registry settings is crucial, as it affects how different applications can access data. Failure to properly configure these settings can make devices more vulnerable to malicious code and network attacks. 

*   **Authentication Service Security:** Mobile devices are often subject to attack through wireless networks. The sources highlight several types of attacks that can exploit vulnerabilities in authentication services, including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, traffic analysis, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and session hijacking. The sources point to several security measures that can help mitigate these risks, including Wireless Application Protocols (WAPs), VPNs, Media Access Control (MAC) address filtering, and the development of security standards like 802.xx.

*   **Cryptographic Security:** The sources explain that cryptographic techniques, such as Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs), can be used to enhance the security of mobile devices. CGAs provide a way to generate IP addresses in a decentralised manner, without relying on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This approach can be useful for protecting IP-layer signaling protocols, including neighbour discovery and mobility protocols. CGAs can also be used for key exchange in opportunistic IPSec. The sources explain that Palm OS devices often use cryptographic security controls. For example, the Cryptographic Provider Manager (CPM) in Palm OS 5 provides a suite of cryptographic services for securing data and resources on Palm-powered devices. The CPM provides encryption services to any application written to take advantage of them, allowing encryption of selected data or of the entire device. 

*   **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Security:** LDAP is a software protocol that is commonly used to locate information on networks. The sources note that LDAP is a lightweight version of Directory Access Protocol (DAP) because it does not include security features in its initial version. However, centralised directories like LDAP make it easy to revoke permissions.

*   **Remote Access Server (RAS) Security:** The sources note that Remote Access Services (RAS) are an important component of mobile device security. They explain that businesses need to protect sensitive data that might be stored on their employees' devices. The sources illustrate how mobile devices can provide a route into the systems they connect with. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers who can use mobile devices to impersonate registered users. Another security threat comes from port scanning, which attackers use to probe devices for vulnerabilities. The sources highlight the importance of personal firewalls for protecting against port scanning. 

*   **Media Player Control Security:** The sources explain that media players can be exploited to gain access to data on mobile devices. For example, they note that Microsoft warned users about a series of flaws in its Windows Media Player that could allow attackers to hijack computers. These flaws could allow attackers to create files that open websites on a user's browser (e.g., a user accessing the site from their mobile device), enabling them to execute remote JavaScript. Attackers can also create files that allow them to download and execute malicious code on a user's device or create media files that cause buffer overrun errors. 

*   **Networking Application Programming Interface (API) Security:** APIs are commonly used to enable software and hardware developers to create applications that can target a range of security platforms. The sources point to the increasing development of APIs specifically designed to secure embedded and consumer products, such as those running operating systems like Linux, Symbian, Microsoft Windows CE, and Microsoft Windows Mobile. These developments aim to significantly improve the security of a range of mobile and consumer devices. The sources suggest that APIs have the potential to enable the creation of new and higher-value services. 

The sources highlight that properly addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that involves user education, technical solutions, and organisational policies and procedures.

# Registry Settings for Mobile Devices

### The Importance of Registry Settings 

The sources explain that **registry settings** are a critical aspect of mobile device security. The sources use the example of **Microsoft ActiveSync** to illustrate this point. ActiveSync is a software application that enables the synchronisation of data between:

*   Windows-powered PCs
*   Microsoft Outlook 
*   Windows mobile-powered devices

ActiveSync acts as a "gateway," facilitating the transfer of various types of data, including:

*   Outlook information
*   Microsoft Office documents
*   Pictures
*   Music 
*   Videos 
*   Applications

ActiveSync can synchronise with a PC, or directly with a Microsoft Exchange Server, allowing users to wirelessly update their:

*   Emails
*   Calendar 
*   Notes 
*   Contacts

The sources stress the importance of establishing **trusted groups** through appropriate registry settings. They explain that **group policy** is one of the most important areas where attention to security is required. Group policy is a core feature of Windows Active Directory that enables administrators to manage a wide range of settings, including security settings, on a network.  

**Key Points about Registry Settings:**

*   The sources state that Microsoft has significantly increased the number of group policy settings in recent years, with a particular emphasis on security. 
*   There are currently almost 1,700 settings in a standard group policy.
*   The sources note that baseline security settings for Windows devices are often not configured correctly, potentially leaving devices vulnerable to attack. 
*   Users can make changes to registry settings to increase the security of their Windows devices, but they may need to make additional changes beyond those available through the standard interface.
*   Registry settings can affect the behaviour of various applications and system components, including the Windows Media Player control.

The sources conclude that, to improve mobile device security, users should be aware of the importance of registry settings and configurations, and understand how to properly manage these settings.

    *   Thieves often target individuals using public transport. 

        *   The sources state that common locations for mobile phone theft include bus stops, railway stations and traffic signals. 

The sources explain that the theft of a mobile phone results in the loss of more than just the physical device; it also results in the loss of:

*   Contact lists
*   Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

The sources note that many insurance companies have stopped offering mobile theft insurance due to a large number of false claims.

*   **Mobile Viruses:** The sources discuss how **mobile viruses** are a growing threat, similar to computer viruses in that they target data and software on mobile devices. The sources explain that:
    *   In 2004, the first mobile virus was identified.
    *   There are currently over 40 mobile virus families and over 300 mobile viruses in existence.
    *   Mobile viruses commonly spread through Bluetooth and Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS).

        *   Bluetooth viruses can infect devices within a 10-30 metre radius.
        *   MMS viruses spread by sending copies of themselves to all the contacts in an infected phone's address book. 

The sources provide examples of mobile viruses such as:

*   **Skull Trojan:** This Trojan targets Series 60 phones that use the Symbian operating system.
*   **Cabir Worm:** This was the first mobile phone worm, and it infects phones that use the Symbian operating system.  The sources state that this worm scans nearby mobile devices for vulnerable phones, and then sends a copy of itself to the first vulnerable phone it finds using Bluetooth. The sources also note that the source code for the Cabir-H and Cabir-I viruses is available online. 
*   **Mosquito Trojan:** This Trojan infects Series 60 smartphones. It is a cracked version of a mobile phone game called "Mosquitos". 
*   **Lasco Worm:** This worm, which was released in 2005, targets mobile phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) that use the Symbian operating system.  It spreads via Bluetooth.

*   **Mishing:** The sources define **mishing** as a combination of mobile phones and phishing. **Phishing**, they explain, is a type of cyberattack that uses disguised emails to trick users into revealing personal information. The sources state that mishing attacks often involve:

    *   **Vishing**, which uses phone calls to obtain personal information. 
    *   **Smishing**, which uses SMS messages to obtain personal information.

The sources note that mishing attackers will often pose as employees of banks or other organisations in an attempt to gain victims' trust.

*   **Vishing:** The sources define **vishing** as the criminal practice of using social engineering over the phone to obtain personal and financial information from the public.  They explain that vishing is a combination of *voice* and *phishing*.  Vishing, the sources state, is commonly used to steal credit card numbers, and often plays a key role in identity theft schemes. 

    The sources explain that criminals use a range of techniques to carry out vishing attacks, including:

    *   Internet emails
    *   Mobile text messages
    *   Voicemails
    *   Direct phone calls

    The sources provide a detailed example of how a vishing attack might be carried out using a direct phone call:

    1.  The attacker uses a war dialer to call phone numbers in a specific region. The phone numbers may have been stolen from a voice messaging company.
    2.  The attacker leaves a voicemail message instructing the recipient to call a specific phone number.
    3.  When the victim returns the call, they are greeted by an automated system that imitates a legitimate company's system.
    4.  The automated system tells the victim that there has been fraudulent activity on their account and instructs them to enter personal information, such as their credit card number, using the phone's keypad.
    5.  Once the victim enters this information, the attacker has everything they need to make fraudulent purchases.



*   **Smishing:** The sources describe **smishing** as a form of phishing that uses SMS messages to trick victims into revealing personal information. Smishing is a combination of *SMS* and *phishing*. They provide examples of smishing messages:

    *   "We are happy to send our confirmation toward your enrolment for our xxxxxx Club Membership how  You will be charged \$0".
    *   "[Name of popular online bank] is confirming that you have purchased LCD TV, worth of  \$.... [If you did not make this order on  [name of popular online company]], Visit www.[bogus website] com to  cancel."

*   **Hacking Bluetooth:** The sources explain that **Bluetooth** is an open wireless technology that enables devices to communicate over short distances. While convenient, the sources note that this technology has various security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.

    They describe a range of attacks that can be carried out by exploiting Bluetooth vulnerabilities, including:

    *   **Bluejacking:** This attack involves sending unsolicited messages, often spam, over Bluetooth to nearby devices.
    *   **Bluesnarfing:** This attack involves gaining unauthorised access to a device through its Bluetooth connection. The sources state that attackers can potentially access a device's calendar, contact list, SMS messages, emails, pictures and videos using this technique.
    *   **Bluebugging:** This is a more serious form of bluejacking, where attackers can potentially gain full control over a victim's device. Attackers can use bluebugging to make phone calls, send and read SMS messages, read and write phonebook contacts, eavesdrop on phone conversations and connect to the internet using the victim's device. 
    *   **Car Whisperer:** This is a software application that can be used to send and receive audio from Bluetooth-enabled car stereos.  The sources state that, while the full extent of the security risks associated with car whisperer is not yet known, researchers are concerned that it could be used for more serious attacks, such as disabling airbags or brakes.

The sources conclude that, due to the widespread use of mobile devices and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, individuals and organisations should be aware of the risks and take appropriate steps to protect themselves.

The sources examine a range of security implications for organisations in the context of the increasing use of mobile and wireless devices.

*   **Managing Diversity & Proliferation of Devices:** The sources underscore the challenges organisations face in managing the diversity and proliferation of mobile devices used by employees. They note that many organisations fail to recognise the long-term importance of tracking device ownership.

    *   The sources recommend that organisations establish a comprehensive **asset register** to document all employee mobile devices, regardless of whether the organisation provided the device. This register should include details such as the device type, serial number, and the employee to whom it is assigned.

        *   Maintaining a detailed asset register can assist organisations in:
            *   Tracking device usage
            *   Identifying potential security risks
            *   Implementing appropriate security measures

    *   Furthermore, the sources recommend that organisations closely monitor device usage to ensure compliance with security policies. They highlight the importance of **provisioning** and **de-provisioning** access to corporate resources when employees join or leave the organisation.
