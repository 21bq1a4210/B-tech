# Proxy Servers and Anonymizer

## Proxy Servers and Anonymizers: Explained

* A **proxy server** acts as an intermediary between a client computer and other servers on a network.
* Attackers use proxy servers to connect to the target system through the proxy, concealing their identity. This allows them to browse the web anonymously and mask their attack.
* Clients using a proxy server send requests for services like files or webpages to the proxy server. The proxy server then evaluates the request, establishes a connection to the relevant server, and retrieves the resource on behalf of the client. 
* Aside from hiding a user's identity, proxy servers have other uses:
    *  Concealing the systems behind them for security reasons.
    *  Speeding up access to resources by caching frequently requested webpages.
    *  Filtering out unwanted content such as advertisements.
    *  Acting as an IP address multiplexer, allowing multiple computers to connect to the internet with a single IP address.
*  **Anonymizers**, or anonymous proxies, aim to make internet activity untraceable by accessing the internet on behalf of the user and hiding the user's identifying information.
* Anonymizers are services that provide anonymity by acting as a proxy server for the web client. 
* They were first developed in 1997 by Lance Cottrell.
* The sources list several websites where free proxy servers and anonymizers can be found.

# Phishing and How Phishing Works

## Phishing: A Detailed Explanation

* **Phishing** is a cybercrime technique that uses deceptive emails to trick internet users into revealing sensitive information, such as personal and financial data.
* These emails are designed to appear genuine, often mimicking communications from legitimate sources like banks, credit card companies, or well-known businesses.
* The term "Phishing" is a play on the word "fishing", as attackers use these emails to "fish" for valuable information from unsuspecting victims.
* **The first recorded use of the term dates back to 1996**. 

### How Phishing Works: A Five-Step Process

Phishing attacks typically follow a five-step process, outlined below:

1. **Planning**: The phisher identifies a specific target, which could be an individual, business, or business house. They then devise a strategy to obtain email addresses associated with their target, often employing mass mailing and address collection techniques similar to those used by spammers.
2. **Setup**: Once the phisher has chosen a target and gathered potential victim email addresses, they establish methods for delivering their deceptive messages and collecting the information they seek. This usually involves setting up spoofed email addresses and creating fake webpages.
3. **Attack**: The phisher launches their attack by sending a carefully crafted email that appears to come from a reputable source. This message is designed to create a sense of urgency or concern, prompting the recipient to take immediate action, such as clicking a link or providing personal information.
4. **Collection**: The phisher's fake webpage, often accessed through a link in the email, is set up to capture any information the victim enters. This could include login credentials, credit card numbers, or other sensitive data.
5. **Identity Theft and Fraud**: Armed with the stolen information, the phisher can engage in identity theft, make unauthorized purchases, or commit other fraudulent activities.

### The Growing Threat of Phishing

* While phishing was initially associated with hacking culture, it has evolved into a widespread global threat.
* This is because more organisations and institutions are providing increased online access to their customers, creating more opportunities for criminals to exploit.
* Phishing attacks are often used in conjunction with other cybercrimes like **identity theft**.
* The sources note that **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**, a type of online attack where the attacker intercepts communication between two parties, can also be used to steal passwords and other sensitive information.
* MITM attacks can target email accounts on popular platforms like Yahoo, Hotmail and Gmail, as well as financial websites for accessing banking information. 


Please note that this response focuses solely on phishing as per your request. While other attack methods like DoS and DDoS attacks are mentioned in the sources, they are not discussed here to maintain focus on your specific query.

# Password Cracking

## Password Cracking Explained

* **Password cracking** is a method of retrieving passwords from stored or transmitted data. It can be used to regain access to a forgotten password, as a preventative security measure by system administrators, or to gain unauthorized access to a system.
* Most commonly, password cracking involves repeated guesses until the correct password is found. This can be done **manually**, by attempting to log in with different passwords, or through the use of automated tools and techniques.
* **Passwords are typically stored in a database**, and a verification process is initiated when a user attempts to log in.
* To protect passwords, the verification data is usually not stored as plain text. Instead, a one-way function, such as an encryption or hashing algorithm, is used. This function combines the entered password with other data, creating a unique value stored in the database. 
* When a user logs in, the same function is applied to the entered password, and the result is compared to the stored value to verify the password. 
* While these functions enhance security, attackers can still target the hashed password. They may attempt to obtain it and then use password cracking tools to test password guesses and recover the original password.

### Online vs. Offline Password Cracking

* **Password cracking attacks can be divided into three categories:** online attacks, offline attacks, and non-electronic attacks. The sources focus on online and offline attacks.

#### 1.1 Online Attacks

* **Online attacks** involve using a script to repeatedly try different passwords against a target system.
* A common type of online attack is the **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack**, where the attacker intercepts the connection between the victim and the server.
* In an MITM attack, the attacker can intercept the login credentials, including the hashed password, and relay them to the legitimate server, allowing the attacker to gain access.
* MITM attacks are often used to target email accounts and financial websites.

#### 1.2 Offline Attacks

* **Offline attacks** are usually conducted from a location separate from where the passwords are stored. 
* These attacks typically require physical access to the target computer system, allowing the attacker to copy the password file.
* The sources provide a table (Table 4.4) that lists different types of offline password cracking attacks, including dictionary attacks, hybrid attacks, and brute force attacks.

### 1.3 Strong, Weak and Random Passwords

#### Weak Passwords

* **Weak passwords** are easily guessed and cracked. They often consist of common words, personal information, simple patterns, or default passwords.

#### Strong Passwords

* **Strong passwords** are designed to be difficult to guess and should be unique to each user.
* The sources list several characteristics of strong passwords:
    * A minimum length of eight alphanumeric characters.
    * A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.
    * Inclusion of digits and punctuation characters.
    * Avoid using dictionary words, personal information, or easily guessable patterns.
    * Should not be written down or stored online.

#### Random Passwords

* **Random passwords** are the most secure type of password. They are created using a mix of characters without any discernible pattern.
* Random passwords can be generated by a computer, making them more resistant to cracking attempts.
* The sources recommend using a password generator and outline several features to include in a password generation process:
    * Password length, symbol inclusion, number inclusion, lowercase and uppercase character inclusion.
    * Exclusion of similar and ambiguous characters.
    * Generation on the client side to avoid sending the password across the internet. 

#### Password Guidelines

* The sources list some important password guidelines for businesses and individuals:
    * Do not use the same password for multiple accounts.
    * Use a password with at least 16 characters, including numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special symbols.
    * Avoid using personal information like names, addresses, phone numbers, or birthdates.
    * Do not use dictionary words or easily cloned information like fingerprints.
    * Do not allow web browsers to store passwords.
    * Avoid logging into important accounts on public computers or networks.
    * Use encrypted connections (HTTPS, SFTP) for transmitting sensitive information.
    * Change passwords regularly (every 10 weeks).
    * Exercise caution when using online paste and screen capture tools to prevent password leakage.
    * Be vigilant about hardware and software keyloggers, and hidden cameras.
* The sources also recommend keeping passwords separate for different accounts, such as business email, personal email, and banking accounts.
* They also highlight the importance of changing passwords from a secure system if the account has been accessed from public internet facilities.
* Passwords should not be stored on mobile phones or PDAs due to their vulnerability to cyberattacks.
* If an account is hacked, contact the relevant agencies or institutions immediately.

# Virus and Worms and Types of Viruses

## A Detailed Examination of Viruses and Worms and Types of Viruses

### Viruses

* A **computer virus** is a program that modifies legitimate programs to include a copy of itself. 
* They spread from one computer to another similar to how biological viruses spread between people.
* Viruses spread without users' knowledge or permission. 
* **They can carry instructions that cause damage or annoyance.**
* Viruses may spread without noticeable symptoms.
* They can be triggered by certain events, time-driven effects, or randomly.

#### Typical Virus Actions

* **Viruses can engage in a variety of actions including:**
    1. Displaying messages prompting an action that triggers the virus.
    2. Deleting files.
    3. Scrambling data on a hard drive.
    4. Causing erratic screen behaviour.
    5. Halting the system.
    6. Replicating to spread further.

* **The term "virus" is often mistakenly used to refer to other malware types that lack the ability to replicate.**
* A true virus can only spread from one system to another when its host (executable code) is transferred, such as via the internet, a network, or removable media.
* **Viruses can increase their chances of spreading by targeting files on a network file system or a file system accessed by another system.**

### Malware

* **Malware** is a broad term used to describe malicious software. It includes viruses, worms, Trojans, rootkits, spyware, dishonest adware, crimeware, and other unwanted software.

### Virus vs. Worms

* **It's important to distinguish between viruses and worms**:
    * **Worms** spread automatically through networks by exploiting security vulnerabilities.
    * **Trojans**, on the other hand, disguise malicious functions within seemingly harmless code or programs.
* **Both worms and Trojans, like viruses, can harm system data or performance.**
* Some viruses and malware display symptoms that alert users, while others are stealthy or remain inactive.
* **Some viruses focus solely on replicating themselves.**

#### Table 4.7 (Difference Between Computer Viruses and Worms)

The sources provide a table to illustrate the differences between viruses and worms, summarising as follows:

* **Different Types:** Viruses encompass various types, including stealth viruses, polymorphic viruses, and macro viruses. Worms are categorized based on their spreading mechanisms, such as email worms, internet worms, and file-sharing worms.
* **Spread Mode:** Viruses require a host program to spread, while worms spread independently without user intervention.
* **Definition:** A virus is a software program that can copy itself and infect data, typically requiring a host program to spread to other computers. A worm is a self-replicating program that spreads through a network, potentially without user intervention.
* **Inception:** The first known virus was the Creeper virus, which spread through ARPANET in the early 1970s. The term "worm" originated from the science fiction novel "The Shockwave Rider."
* **Prevalence:** Computer viruses are far more prevalent than worms.

### Types of Viruses

The sources outline several categories of viruses:

* **Boot Sector Viruses:** These viruses infect the storage media containing the operating system, specifically the boot sector, which is responsible for loading the OS during startup.
* **Program Viruses:** Program viruses become active when an infected program file is executed. 
* **Multipartite Viruses:** These are a combination of boot sector and program viruses, infecting both program files and the boot record.
* **Stealth Viruses:** Stealth viruses conceal themselves to avoid detection, even by antivirus software.
* **Polymorphic Viruses:** These viruses change their signature every time they spread, making them harder to detect.
* **Macro Viruses:** Macro viruses infect macros within applications like Microsoft Word and Excel.
* **Active X and Java Control:** These exploit vulnerabilities in web browser settings for Active X and Java Controls.

### World's Worst Virus and Worm Attacks

The sources provide a list of some of the most damaging virus and worm attacks, including:

* **Conficker:** Also known as Downup, Downadup, and Kido, this virus targets Microsoft Windows and was first detected in 2008. It exploits flaws in Windows software and uses dictionary attacks on administrator passwords to control infected machines.
* **INF/AutoRun:** This attack exploits the AutoRun and AutoPlay features in Microsoft Windows, which dictate actions taken when a drive is mounted. This is a common threat vector used to spread malware from removable devices. 
* **Win32 PSW.OnLineGames:** This virus replicates rapidly and targets gamers, stealing confidential and financial credentials.
* **Win32/Agent:** This Trojan steals information from infected systems and adds entries into the registry to ensure it runs on every startup. 
* **Win32/FlyStudio:** This Trojan acts as a backdoor, allowing attackers to access infected systems and steal information. 
* **Win32/Pacex.Gen:** This category includes malware that uses obfuscation to conceal its malicious activities, such as stealing passwords. 
* **Win32/Qhost:** This virus modifies DNS settings to redirect users to malicious websites or prevent them from accessing legitimate ones. It can also block access to security updates and redirect users to sites that download other malware.
* **WMA/TrojanDownloader.GetCodec:** This threat modifies audio files and adds a URL header pointing to a malicious codec. When users try to play the audio file, they are forced to download the codec, which also delivers additional malware. 

The sources also provide a table (Table 4.9) that lists some of the world's worst worm attacks, including:

* **Morris Worm:** This worm, also known as the "Great Worm" or "Internet Worm," was launched in 1988 and infected thousands of Unix machines. 
* **ILOVEYOU:** This worm, also known as the "Love Bug Worm," spread rapidly in 2000 via email attachments disguised as love letters. 
* **Nimda:** This worm spread quickly in 2001, affecting both Windows workstations and servers. 
* **Code Red:** This worm exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft's IIS web server in 2001.
* **Melissa:** This mass-mailing macro worm spread rapidly through email attachments in 1999.
* **MSBlast:** This worm, also known as Lovsan or Lovesan, spread through a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows in 2003. 
* **Sobig:** This worm, discovered in 2003, spread through email attachments and network shares. It also installed a backdoor on infected systems, allowing attackers to remotely control them.
* **Storm Worm:** This worm, discovered in 2007, spread through email attachments disguised as news reports about a storm in Europe. 
* **Michelangelo:** This worm, discovered in 1991, targeted DOS systems and infected the boot sector of hard drives. 
* **Jerusalem:** This worm, also known as "BlackBox," infected executable files on DOS systems and was discovered in 1987.

It's worth noting that the distinction between viruses and worms can sometimes be blurred, and some malware might exhibit characteristics of both.

# Trojan Horses and Backdoors

## Understanding and Protecting Against Trojan Horses and Backdoors

### 1. Trojan Horses

A **Trojan Horse** is a type of malware disguised as legitimate software to trick users into installing it. Once installed, the Trojan executes its malicious code, compromising the system. They differ from viruses and worms in that they don't replicate themselves.

**Trojans infiltrate systems in various ways:**

* Bundled with other software downloads.
* Through email attachments.
* Via web browsers.
* Transferred through infected portable media like USB drives.

**Trojan Threats:**

Trojans can pose significant threats to computer systems, including:

# Steganography: Steganalysis

## Steganography and Steganalysis: A Summary

**Steganography** is a method of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.  The word itself originates from Greek, combining "steganos" (meaning covered or concealed) and "graphein" (meaning writing).  In essence, it aims to hide the very existence of a message. 

* Steganography is often confused with cryptography, but they are distinct concepts. 
* Other terms for steganography include data hiding, information hiding, and digital watermarking.

**Digital watermarking**, a specific application of steganography, involves embedding information into a digital signal, such as audio, pictures, or video. This embedded information persists even when the signal is copied.  

* Watermarking can be used to track illegal copying of digital images, supporting data confidentiality and integrity.

**Steganalysis**, on the other hand, focuses on *detecting* messages hidden using steganography. Its goal is to identify suspicious files, determine if they contain hidden payloads, and potentially recover those payloads. 

* Steganalysis relies on automated tools to identify steganographic data concealed within images, audio, and video files.

The sources provide further details on steganography, highlighting its history and contrasting it with cryptography.

* The concept of steganography is not new. Ancient examples include etching messages into wooden tablets and then covering them with wax, or even tattooing messages on messengers' shaved heads.
* While both steganography and cryptography aim to protect information, they differ in their approaches. 
    * **Cryptography** focuses on scrambling the message's content so it's unreadable without the decryption key. The existence of the message is not hidden, but its meaning is obscured. 
    * **Steganography** focuses on concealing the very existence of the message. It aims to hide the message so completely that no one, except the intended recipient, suspects its presence.

The sources discuss an example of steganography's potential for misuse:

* It has been suggested that terrorists may use steganography to hide communications within images on the internet.  The use of common images, such as those of celebrities, might make such hidden messages less likely to arouse suspicion.

The sources also mention a specific instance where steganography may have been used for malicious purposes:

* An article in *The New York Times* in 2001 claimed that al-Qaeda potentially used steganography to hide messages in images.  These images were allegedly transmitted via email or Usenet and may have played a role in the planning and execution of the September 11 attacks. 

The sources provide a diagram (Figure 4.4) illustrating the basic process of steganography, highlighting the key elements involved:

* **Cover Medium:** The original, innocent file, message, or data that will be used to hide the secret message.
* **Stegokey:** A secret key or password used to embed and extract the hidden message.
* **Message to Hide:** The secret information to be concealed.
* **Stego-Medium:** The resulting file, message, or data containing the hidden message.

The sources also list various steganography tools, both for hiding and detecting hidden messages. 

**It's important to note that the claim about al-Qaeda using steganography is based on a single source () and requires further verification.**

# DoS and DDoS Attacks

## Understanding DoS and DDoS Attacks

### 1.1. DoS Attacks

A **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack** aims to render a computer resource, such as an information system, inaccessible to its intended users.  The attacker attempts to overwhelm the target's network bandwidth or flood its systems with requests, ultimately preventing legitimate users from accessing the service. DoS attacks can target various entities, including high-profile web servers hosting websites like banks, payment gateways, and even root name servers. 

The sources highlight **Spoofing** as a common technique used in DoS attacks. IP address spoofing involves creating IP packets with a fake source IP address to hide the attacker's identity or impersonate another system. This allows the attacker to flood the victim's network with requests, leaving the victim waiting for responses that will never arrive, further consuming bandwidth and crippling the system.

The sources list several **symptoms of DoS attacks**:

* Unusually sluggish network performance, particularly when opening files or accessing websites.
* Inability to access specific websites or any websites at all.
* A sudden and substantial increase in the number of spam emails, often referred to as an email bomb.

Importantly, the primary goal of a DoS attack is **not to gain unauthorised access to systems or data** but to disrupt the target's services and make them unavailable to legitimate users. The sources outline **potential consequences of a DoS attack**:

* Flooding a network with traffic, effectively blocking legitimate network traffic.
* Disrupting connections between systems, leading to service inaccessibility.
* Preventing specific individuals from accessing a service.
* Disrupting service targeted at a particular system or person.

### 1.2. Classification of DoS Attacks

The sources categorise DoS attacks into four main types:

1. **Bandwidth Attacks**: These attacks exploit the limited bandwidth allocated to a website's hosting. By overloading the website with traffic, exceeding its bandwidth capacity, the attacker can force the site offline.
2. **Logic Attacks**: This category involves exploiting vulnerabilities in network software, such as web servers or the TCP/IP stack, to disrupt services.
3. **Protocol Attacks**: These attacks target the rules (protocols) governing data transmission over networks. By exploiting flaws in the implementation of these protocols, attackers can cause excessive resource consumption, leading to denial of service.
4. **Unintentional DoS Attacks**: Unlike deliberate attacks, unintentional DoS can occur when a website experiences an unexpected surge in popularity. This sudden influx of traffic can overwhelm the site's resources, leading to service disruption.

### 1.3. Types or Levels of DoS Attacks

The sources describe several specific types of DoS attacks:

1. **Flood Attack (Ping Flood)**: The most basic form of DoS attack, the flood attack, involves bombarding the victim with an overwhelming number of ping packets using the "ping" command. This results in more traffic than the victim can manage, causing service disruption. While easy to launch, it is challenging to defend against completely. 
2. **Ping of Death Attack**: This attack leverages a vulnerability in the handling of oversized ICMP packets by some systems. By sending packets exceeding the maximum allowed size (65,536 octets), the attacker can crash, freeze, or reboot the victim's system, resulting in a DoS. 
3. **SYN Attack (TCP SYN Flooding)**: Exploiting the TCP handshake process, a SYN attack involves the attacker sending a flood of SYN requests to the target server. The server responds with SYN-ACK packets, but the attacker never completes the handshake by sending the final ACK. This ties up the server's resources, eventually preventing legitimate connections.
4. **Teardrop Attack**: This attack involves sending fragmented IP packets with overlapping data segments to the target system. When the target tries to reassemble these corrupted packets, it can lead to system crashes or hangs. The Teardrop attack exploits a bug in the TCP/IP fragmentation reassembly code of certain operating systems.
5. **Smurf Attack**: A Smurf attack leverages spoofed broadcast ping messages to amplify network traffic and flood the victim's network. The attacker sends a ping request to a network's broadcast address, spoofing the source IP address to be that of the victim. All devices on the network respond to this ping, flooding the victim with replies.
6. **Nuke**: An older DoS attack, Nuke involves sending a stream of fragmented or invalid ICMP packets to the target system, overwhelming its resources and potentially causing it to crash.

### 1.4. Tools used to Launch DoS Attack

The sources list various tools used for launching DoS attacks. Each tool utilises different techniques and traffic types to flood the victim and disrupt their services:

1. **Jolt2**: Exploits a vulnerability in Windows networking code to force the target machine to spend all its CPU time processing malicious packets, effectively preventing it from responding to legitimate requests.
2. **Nemesy**: Generates random packets with spoofed source IP addresses, allowing the attacker to launch DoS attacks without revealing their true location.
3. **Targa**: A versatile tool capable of executing eight different DoS attacks. The attacker can either launch individual attacks or cycle through all attacks until one succeeds.
4. **Crazy Pinger**: Floods the target network with oversized ICMP packets, similar to the Ping of Death attack.
5. **SomeTrouble**: Acts as a remote flooder and bomber, overwhelming the target system with excessive traffic.

### 1.5. DDoS Attacks

A **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack** expands on the concept of a DoS attack by utilising multiple compromised systems (zombies) to flood the target with traffic. This distributed approach significantly amplifies the attack's potency, making it even more challenging to mitigate.

The attacker compromises these zombie systems, often by exploiting vulnerabilities or through malware like Trojans, and then uses them as weapons to launch a coordinated attack against the primary victim. 

The sources mention **MyDoom** as an example of malware capable of carrying DDoS attack mechanisms. This malware can be triggered to launch a DDoS attack on a specific date and time, with the target IP address hardcoded into the malware, requiring no further interaction from the attacker.

**Botnets**, networks of compromised computers controlled by a single attacker, have become a popular tool for launching DDoS attacks. Attackers can also leverage automated tools to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept connections from remote hosts, further expanding their control over zombie systems.

### 1.6. How to Protect from DoS and DDoS Attacks

The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) provides several recommendations to protect against DoS and DDoS attacks:

* **Implement Router Filters**: Filtering traffic at the router level can help mitigate certain DoS attacks by blocking malicious packets before they reach the target system.
* **Install Patches**: Applying security patches promptly can protect against known vulnerabilities, including those exploited in TCP SYN flooding attacks.
* **Disable Unnecessary Services**: Reducing the attack surface by disabling unused or non-essential network services limits the attacker's options for exploiting vulnerabilities.
* **Enable Quota Systems**: If available, quota systems can help prevent individual users or processes from consuming excessive resources, mitigating the impact of certain DoS attacks.
* **Monitor System Performance**: Establishing baselines for normal system activity, including disk activity, CPU usage, and network traffic, can help detect unusual spikes that might indicate an ongoing DoS attack.
* **Review Physical Security**: Ensuring proper physical security measures for servers and network equipment can prevent unauthorised access and potential compromise.
* **Use Intrusion Detection Systems**: Tools like Tripwire can alert administrators to changes in configuration files or other critical system files, potentially indicating an intrusion or attack.
* **Maintain Hot Spares**: Having spare machines ready for deployment can help quickly restore services if a primary system is disabled due to an attack.
* **Invest in Redundancy**: Redundant and fault-tolerant network configurations can mitigate the impact of DoS attacks by ensuring service continuity even if some systems are unavailable.
* **Regular Backups**: Regularly backing up critical data allows for data restoration in case of data corruption or loss due to an attack.
* **Strong Password Policies**: Enforcing strong password policies for all user accounts, especially privileged ones, helps prevent unauthorised access and system compromise, reducing the risk of being used in a DDoS attack.

The sources also mention several tools specifically designed to detect and mitigate DoS/DDoS attacks:

* **Zombie Zapper**: A free and open-source tool that identifies compromised systems (zombies) participating in DDoS attacks. It can disable the attack functionality on these systems.
* **Remote Intrusion Detector (RID)**: Analyses network traffic to identify and block DDoS attack traffic. It can detect various DDoS attack types, including Trinoo, Stacheldrahr, and TFN.
* **Security Auditor's Research Assistant (SARA)**: A comprehensive security auditing tool that can identify potential security vulnerabilities, including those that could be exploited for DoS attacks. 
* **Find_DDoS**: Scans local systems to identify the presence of known DDoS attack tools.
* **DDoSPing**: Functions as a remote network scanner, identifying systems running common DDoS attack tools, such as Trinoo, Stacheldraht, and Tribe Flood Network.


By implementing these proactive measures and utilising appropriate tools, organisations can significantly reduce their risk of becoming victims of DoS and DDoS attacks and ensure the availability of their critical systems and services.

# SQL Injection

## Preventing SQL Injection Attacks

**SQL injection** is a code injection technique used to exploit security vulnerabilities in the database layer of an application. These vulnerabilities arise when user input isn't properly filtered or validated, allowing attackers to insert malicious code into SQL statements. Attackers often target SQL servers, which store sensitive data like credit card details, social security numbers, and passwords. 

### 1.1. Steps for a Typical SQL Injection Attack

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how an SQL injection attack typically unfolds:

1. **Identifying Vulnerable Webpages**: Attackers search for webpages where users can input data, such as login pages, search bars, and feedback forms. They analyse the source code, looking for HTML tags like "FORM" that signal potential entry points for malicious SQL code.

2. **Analysing Source Code**: Attackers scrutinise the webpage's HTML source code, specifically focusing on the content between `<FORM>` and `</FORM>` tags. They look for parameters that might expose vulnerabilities.

3. **Testing for Vulnerability**: Attackers use single quotes (') in input fields to determine if the server interprets user input literally. If the server returns an error message like "use 'a' = 'a'", it indicates susceptibility to SQL injection.

4. **Exploiting the Vulnerability**: Once a vulnerability is confirmed, attackers inject malicious SQL commands, such as `SELECT` to extract data or `INSERT` to add information to the database. The sources provide examples of commands attackers might use:
    * `Blah’ or 1=1--`
    * `Login:blah’ or 1=1--`
    * `Password::blah’ or 1=1--`
    * `http://search/index.asp?id=blah’ or 1=1—`

    The attacker leverages these commands to bypass login authentication, potentially gaining access to entire database tables. The double dashes (--) at the end instruct the SQL server to ignore the remainder of the command, treating it as a comment.

### 1.2. Protecting Against SQL Injection Attacks

The sources emphasise that SQL injection attacks stem from inadequate website administration and coding practices. To safeguard against these attacks, implement the following measures:

1. **Robust Input Validation**: This is crucial in preventing malicious code injection. Here's what effective input validation entails:
    * **Escaping Single Quotes**: Replacing all single quotes with two single quotes neutralises their potential for code manipulation.
    * **Sanitising User Input**: Carefully examine and cleanse user input to remove any characters or strings that could be used maliciously. Specifically, watch out for character sequences like `;`, `--`, `select`, `insert`, and `xp_`.
    * **Validating Numeric Input**: Ensure that input intended to be numeric is indeed numeric. In the context of Active Server Pages (ASP), the `IsNumeric()` function effectively validates numeric values.
    * **Limiting Input Length**: Keep input fields as short as possible to restrict the potential length of malicious input.

2. **Modified Error Reporting**: To prevent attackers from gaining insights into the database structure through error messages, configure systems to avoid displaying SQL errors to external users.

3. **Additional Preventive Measures**: Implement the following best practices to bolster your system's security posture:
    * **Secure Default Accounts**: Never use the default system accounts provided in SQL Server 2000.
    * **Server Isolation**: Separate the database server and web server, hosting them on different machines to limit the attacker's reach in case of compromise.
    * **Secure Stored Procedures**:  If you need to use extended stored procedures like `xp_cmdshell` and `xp_grantlogin`, move them to an isolated server to minimize potential damage from SQL injection. 

By adhering to these preventive measures, organisations can significantly reduce their vulnerability to SQL injection attacks and protect their sensitive data.

# BufferOverflow

## Types and Mitigation of Buffer Overflow

A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to store more data in a buffer (a temporary data storage area) than it can hold. Excess data spills over into adjacent memory locations, potentially overwriting important data or instructions. While buffer overflows can be accidental, they are frequently exploited by attackers to compromise system security.

### 1.1. Types of Buffer Overflow

The sources detail two primary types of buffer overflows:

*   **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow**: This type occurs when a program writes beyond the allocated space within the program's call stack. The call stack is a memory region used for storing function parameters, local variables, and return addresses. Attackers exploit this by overwriting:
    *   Local variables to modify the program's behavior.
    *   The return address, redirecting the program's execution flow to malicious code.
    *   Function pointers or exception handlers, causing the program to execute attacker-supplied code.

    Factors that can make these exploits challenging include null bytes in addresses, variations in shellcode location, and differences between environments.

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow**:  This occurs in the heap, a memory area used for dynamically allocated objects. This type is more complex to exploit but can be equally damaging. Attackers corrupt heap data to overwrite internal structures like linked list pointers, eventually manipulating the program's behavior.

### 1.2. Minimising Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

While complete prevention of buffer overflow attacks is difficult, several methods can significantly reduce risk:

*   **Secure Coding Practices**: Developers should be trained to avoid unsafe functions like `strcpy()`, `strcat()`, `sprintf()`, and `vsprintf()` in C language, as these functions don't perform bounds checking, making them susceptible to buffer overflows. 

*   **Disabling Stack Execution**: This security measure prevents attackers from executing malicious code injected into the stack. However, some compilers like GCC use 'trampoline' functions that require stack execution, making implementation challenging.

*   **Compiler Tools**: Modern compilers can detect potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities during compilation. They issue warnings for unsafe functions like `gets()` and `strcpy()`, prompting developers to modify their code.

*   **Dynamic Runtime Checks**:  Security tools like `libsafe` are preloaded before application execution. They either offer safer versions of vulnerable functions or safeguard return addresses from being overwritten, adding an extra layer of protection during runtime. 

The sources also list some tools designed to defend against buffer overflow attacks:

*   **StackGuard**: Introduced in 1997, it’s a GCC extension that protects against "stack-smashing" attacks. It detects ongoing exploits and halts the program, preventing further damage.

*   **ProPolice**: Also known as SSP, it enhances the StackGuard concept. Specifically designed for C and C++, it is available as an option in Gentoo Linux.

*   **LibSafe**: This library secures calls to potentially unsafe functions even if those functions aren't directly available. It examines the stack frame, verifying the distance to the nearest return address, and ensures that the address remains uncorrupted during function execution.

# Attacks on Wireless Networks

## Attacks on Wireless Networks

### 1.1. Traditional Techniques of Attacks on Wireless Networks

**Wireless cracking**, the unauthorised penetration of a wireless network, can be achieved through several methods. The availability of various software tools has made wireless cracking less sophisticated, requiring minimal technological skill. Some of these methods are:

*   **Sniffing** involves intercepting and analysing wireless data being broadcasted on an unsecured network. This technique, also known as **passive scanning**, helps attackers gather information about active Wi-Fi networks. Attackers commonly use **sniffers**, which they install on the victim's system remotely to perform actions like:
    *   Passive scanning of the wireless network.
    *   Detecting the Service Set Identifier (SSID).
    *   Gathering the Media Access Control (MAC) address.
    *   Obtaining frames to crack Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).
*   **Spoofing** aims to deceive systems by falsifying data to gain an unfair advantage. An attacker might establish a new network that mimics a legitimate one by using a stronger wireless signal and copying the SSID. Unsuspecting computers would automatically connect to the fake network, allowing the attacker to:
    *   Control address lists on servers or routers.
    *   Impersonate another network device.
    *   Modify packet headers.
*   **Denial of service (DoS)** attacks aim to disrupt network services and make them unavailable to legitimate users. This is discussed in detail in Section 4.9.
*   **Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)** involves an attacker intercepting communication between two hosts without their knowledge. The attacker, positioned between the hosts, can observe or manipulate the communication for malicious purposes.
*   **Encryption cracking** targets the security mechanisms that protect wireless data. While WPA encryption is generally recommended, attackers constantly develop new techniques to break older encryption methods. Using a long and random encryption key can make cracking considerably more difficult.

### 1.2. Theft of Internet Hours and Wi-Fi-based Frauds and Misuses

Wireless technologies like Wi-Fi have made it easy for individuals to access the internet. Unfortunately, the increased availability of open Wi-Fi networks has also led to the rise of cybercrime, including:

*   **Stealing internet hours**: Cybercriminals often seek to exploit unsecured Wi-Fi connections to avoid paying for internet access. They might target home networks, where security measures are often less robust. To achieve this, attackers may try to:
    *   Identify unsecured Wi-Fi connections by **wardriving**. Wardriving involves searching for open Wi-Fi networks while driving around. Attackers may use software tools like NetStumbler for Windows or Kismet for Linux to detect and collect information from wireless access points.
    *   Access the router's settings by finding the router's IP address. This can be achieved by using the `ipconfig` command in Windows or by examining network settings.
*   **Wi-Fi based frauds**: Public Wi-Fi hotspots can be particularly vulnerable to attacks. Attackers might:
    *   Create fake hotspots that mimic legitimate ones. Unsuspecting users connecting to these fake hotspots might unknowingly expose their sensitive information, like login credentials and passwords, to the attackers.
    *   Use **packet sniffing** to intercept and analyse data transmitted over the network. This allows them to steal sensitive information like user IDs, passwords, and other confidential data.

### 1.3. How to Secure the Wireless Networks

Securing wireless networks, especially for home users, is crucial in preventing cyberattacks. The sources recommend the following measures to enhance the security of a wireless network:

*   **Change default settings**: This includes changing default IP addresses, user IDs, and administrator passwords for all components of the wireless network, like the router and access points.
*   **Enable WPA/WEP encryption**: Using robust encryption protocols like WPA or WPA2 strengthens network security and makes it harder for attackers to eavesdrop on data transmission.
*   **Change the default SSID**: The SSID is the name of the wireless network. Changing it from the default setting makes it harder for attackers to identify and target the network.
*   **Enable MAC address filtering**: Allowing only devices with specific MAC addresses to access the network can significantly limit unauthorised access.
*   **Disable remote login**: Disabling this feature prevents attackers from gaining access to the router's settings remotely.
*   **Disable SSID broadcast**: Turning off SSID broadcasting makes the network less visible to potential attackers.
*   **Disable unused features in the AP**: This includes disabling features like printing or music support that are not being used.
*   **Choose a secure network name**: Avoid using easily identifiable network names like "My_Home_Wifi".
*   **Connect only to secured networks**: Users should be cautious when connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots and avoid auto-connecting to open networks.
*   **Upgrade router firmware periodically**: Keeping the router's firmware up to date ensures that the latest security patches and updates are installed.
*   **Assign static IP addresses to devices**: This can enhance network management and security.
*   **Enable firewalls on each computer and the router**: Firewalls act as a barrier between the network and potential threats, blocking unauthorised access and malicious traffic.
*   **Position the router or AP safely**: Placing the router in a secure location, away from potential eavesdroppers, can improve security.
*   **Turn off the network when not in use**: This can minimise the window of opportunity for attackers.
*   **Regularly monitor wireless network security**: Regularly scanning for vulnerabilities and monitoring network activity helps detect and address potential security threats promptly.

The sources also list some software tools that can help protect wireless networks, such as Zamzom Wireless Network Tool and AirDefense Guard. You may want to independently verify the features and effectiveness of these tools.
