# Understanding the harmony in the Nature

## Harmony in Nature

The sources describe nature as a collection of units existing within space. The four orders of nature – **material, plant/bio (pranic), animal, and human** – are interconnected and designed to exist in a state of mutual fulfillment. 

### Mutual Fulfilment and Interconnectedness

*   The **material order** provides nutrients to the **plant/bio order** in the form of soil, minerals, and water. In return, the plant/bio order decomposes and enriches the soil.
*   The **plant/bio order** also provides food and shelter to the **animal order**, while animals aid in seed dispersal and pollination.
*   **Human beings** have the capacity to understand these relationships and ensure their continuation. Ideally, they should participate in a way that benefits all orders, but often, due to a lack of right understanding, they end up exploiting and harming nature.

### Recyclability and Self-Regulation

Nature is characterised by **cyclical processes** and **self-regulation**.&#x20;

*   Natural resources are constantly recycled, for example, water evaporates, condenses, and precipitates back to Earth.
*   The population of different species is naturally regulated to maintain balance. For example, the number of deer, tigers, and grass in a forest will always be in proportion to ensure the survival of all.
*   These inherent features of nature ensure sustainability and harmony.

### Understanding the Four Orders in Detail

The four orders can be further understood in terms of their **things (units), activities, innateness, natural characteristics (svabhava), and conformance**.&#x20;

#### Material Order

*   Consists of soil, water, metals, and other non-living things.
*   Its innateness is **existence**, as matter cannot be destroyed, only transformed.
*   Its natural characteristic is **composition/decomposition**.
*   It exhibits **constitution conformance**, meaning that every unit conforms to the structure of its kind. For example, all atoms of iron will conform to the structure of iron.

#### Plant/Bio Order

*   Includes plants, trees, and vegetation.
*   In addition to **existence**, its innateness also includes **growth**, as all plants have an inherent tendency to grow.
*   Its natural characteristic is to **nurture or worsen** other pranic units. For example, eating vegetables nourishes the body, while consuming poisonous plants harms it.
*   It exhibits **seed inheritance conformance**, ensuring the continuity of species through seeds.

#### Animal Order

*   Includes animals and birds.
*   Its innateness comprises **existence, growth**, and the **will to live**.
*   Its natural characteristics are **composition/decomposition, nurture/worsen**, and **cruelty/non-cruelty**.
*   It follows **body conformance**, meaning offspring will physically resemble their parents.

#### Human Order

*   Consists of human beings.
*   Its innateness includes **existence, growth**, and the **will to live with happiness**.
*   Its natural characteristics are **composition/decomposition, nurture/worsen**, and, ideally, **perseverance, bravery, and generosity**. However, humans often deviate from these values due to a lack of right understanding.
*   It can exhibit **character conformance** when humans live in accordance with their true nature, but this is often not the case.

### Human Beings: Animal Consciousness vs. Human Consciousness

The sources highlight that while humans have the potential for **human consciousness**, which is characterised by right understanding, relationship, and physical facilities, they often operate from **animal consciousness**, driven by the need for physical facilities alone. This lack of understanding leads to conflict and disharmony within themselves and with nature.

### Conclusion

Understanding the harmony in nature involves recognizing the interconnectedness and mutual fulfillment of all its orders. It requires acknowledging the cyclical processes, self-regulation, and distinct characteristics of each order. Humans, as conscious beings, have a unique responsibility to understand their role in nature and participate in a way that sustains this harmony.&#x20;

# Interconnectedness and mutual fulfilment among the four orders of nature recyclability and self regulation in nature

## Exploring Interconnectedness, Mutual Fulfilment, Recyclability, and Self-Regulation in Nature

The sources describe nature as a harmonious system where the four orders – **material, plant/bio (pranic), animal, and human** – are interconnected and mutually fulfilling. This harmony is further sustained by the principles of **recyclability and self-regulation**.

### Interconnectedness and Mutual Fulfilment

The four orders of nature exist in a delicate balance, where each order supports and benefits from the others. This can be seen through several examples:

*   **Material and Plant/Bio Orders:** The material order provides the foundation for the plant/bio order. Soil, minerals, water, and gases are essential for plant growth. In turn, plants enrich the soil through decomposition, hold the soil together, preventing erosion, and contribute to the cycling of gases in the atmosphere. This relationship showcases a beautiful cycle of mutual dependence and enrichment.
*   **Plant/Bio and Animal Orders:** Plants provide food and shelter for animals. Animals, in turn, contribute to pollination, seed dispersal, and the enrichment of soil through their excreta. This symbiotic relationship ensures the continuation of both plant and animal life.
*   **All Orders and Human Order:** Humans rely on all other orders for survival. The material order provides resources, the plant/bio order provides food and oxygen, and the animal order can be utilized for various purposes. Ideally, humans should understand this dependence and act in a way that sustains these orders. However, due to a lack of right understanding, humans often exploit and harm nature, disrupting the balance.

### Recyclability and Self-Regulation

Nature has an amazing capacity for self-renewal and balance through the principles of recyclability and self-regulation.

*   **Recyclability:** Natural resources are constantly recycled. The water cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, and oxygen cycle are all examples of this continuous process. These cycles ensure that resources are not depleted and waste is naturally processed.
*   **Self-regulation:** The population of different species is naturally regulated to maintain equilibrium within an ecosystem. Predators and prey, the availability of resources, and environmental conditions all play a role in this balance. This prevents the overpopulation of any single species and ensures the long-term health of the ecosystem.

# Q. Explain about the interconnectedness among the four orders in nature.

## Interconnectedness of the Four Orders in Nature

The sources describe nature as being composed of four distinct orders: **Material, Plant/Bio (Pranic), Animal, and Human**. These orders are not isolated but exist in a web of interconnectedness, with each order playing a crucial role in supporting the others. This interconnectedness is manifested through **mutual fulfillment, recyclability, and self-regulation**, creating a harmonious balance within the natural world. 

**Mutual Fulfillment**: Each order provides something essential to the other orders, creating a system of interdependence. Here's how:

* **Material Order and Plant/Bio Order:** The Material Order, comprising soil, water, air, and minerals, provides nutrients for the Plant/Bio Order. In turn, plants enrich the soil through decomposition, hold soil together with their roots, and contribute to the cycling of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
* **Material Order, Plant/Bio Order, and Animal Order:**  The Material Order provides the basis for movement and essential elements like water and oxygen for both plants and animals. Animals contribute to soil fertility through their excreta, which nourishes plants. Plants provide food for animals, while animals assist in pollination.
* **All Four Orders**: Ideally, all four orders exist in a state of mutual fulfillment, where each benefits from the others. However, the sources highlight that humans, despite benefiting from the other three orders, often disrupt this balance through unsustainable practices.

**Recyclability**:  Nature operates in cycles, constantly regenerating and reusing resources. This cyclical nature is evident in processes like:

* **Water Cycle**:  Water evaporates, condenses, and precipitates, ensuring a continuous supply of this essential resource.
* **Nutrient Cycles**:  Nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are constantly cycled through the ecosystem, supporting life processes.

**Self-regulation**: Nature possesses an inherent ability to maintain balance and stability. This self-regulation is apparent in:

* **Population Control**: Natural mechanisms regulate the populations of different species, preventing any one species from dominating the ecosystem.
* **Resource Management**:  The growth and distribution of plants and animals are naturally controlled to ensure the sustainable use of resources like soil, water, and sunlight.

The sources emphasize that human activities, driven by a lack of understanding of this interconnectedness, have disrupted these natural cycles and balances, leading to problems like pollution, resource depletion, and climate change.

## Q. What do you mean by innateness? What is the innateness in the four orders?

## Innateness: The Inseparable Quality of Each Order in Nature

The sources define **innateness** as an **intrinsic quality that cannot be separated from a unit or entity in existence**. It represents the fundamental nature of a thing, its inherent way of being. This concept is also referred to as "_Dhãranã_" in the sources.

To better illustrate this concept, the sources use the analogy of identifying trees like neem or mango by their specific, unchanging characteristics. Just as a mango tree has an inherent "mango-ness," each order in nature possesses an innateness that defines its existence and participation within the larger web of life.

### Innateness in the Four Orders:

**1. Material Order:**

*   **Innateness:**  **Existence** is the defining innateness of the Material Order.  This means that material things can be transformed from one form to another, but they cannot be completely annihilated or cease to exist. The fundamental particles composing these units persist, even if their form changes. For instance, burning coal transforms it into ash and gases, but the basic particles remain in existence, albeit in different forms.

**2. Plant/Bio (Pranic) Order:**

*   **Innateness:**  The Plant/Bio Order inherits **existence** from the Material Order since it is a development upon it. Additionally, it exhibits **growth** as an inseparable characteristic.  Any unit belonging to this order will inevitably grow, respire, and change.  The only way to stop its growth is to cut it off from its life source, at which point it decays and reverts back to the Material Order.

**3. Animal Order:**

*   **Innateness:**  The Animal Order, with its physical body developed from the Plant/Bio Order,  possesses both **existence** and **growth**.  However, at the level of consciousness, its innateness is the **"will to live,"** also known as "_jïne kï % %asa_" in the sources.  This inherent drive to survive cannot be separated from any animal, residing in its consciousness ('I') rather than its physical body.

**4. Human Order:**

*   **Innateness:**  Humans, like animals, possess **existence** and **growth** at the physical level.  However, the innateness of human consciousness ('I') extends beyond mere survival to encompass the **"will to live with happiness."** This inherent desire for happiness and its continuity distinguishes humans from the Animal Order.  While animals primarily act on instinct and immediate needs, humans possess a need to understand the world around them and seek fulfillment beyond basic survival. The sources highlight this distinction by stating " _mãnav sukha dharmï hai_," meaning that the pursuit of happiness is an inseparable characteristic of human beings.

# Q. Closely examine four orders in nature and their participation, explain present state of participation of human order.

## A Detailed Look at the Four Orders in Nature and Their Participation: A Focus on the Current State of the Human Order

The sources present a comprehensive framework for understanding nature and the interconnectedness of all its elements. This framework categorises nature into four distinct orders: **Material, Plant/Bio (Pranic), Animal, and Human**. Each order is characterised by specific activities, natural characteristics, and ways of conforming to the larger order of existence.

### Examining Each Order and its Natural Role:

*   **Material Order:** This order encompasses the most fundamental building blocks of nature, including soil, water, air, metals, and various forms of energy. Its primary activity is **composition and decomposition**: coming together to form larger units and breaking down into smaller units. This order does not "grow" in the sense of biological growth but rather undergoes continuous transformation. Its natural characteristic is to be **supportive** of the other orders by providing the basic elements necessary for their existence. The Material Order conforms to the laws of physics and chemistry, exhibiting **constitution conformance**. For example, every atom of iron will inherently possess the characteristics that define it as iron.

*   **Plant/Bio (Pranic) Order:** This order includes a wide range of life forms, from single-celled organisms to complex plants and trees. It inherits the characteristic of **existence** from the Material Order and additionally exhibits **growth** and **respiration** as inherent activities. The Plant/Bio Order nurtures the other orders by providing food, oxygen, and contributing to the regulation of ecosystems. Its natural characteristic is to **nurture or worsen**, depending on the context of its interaction with other units. For example, certain plants provide nourishment, while others can be harmful if consumed.  This order conforms to the laws of biology and genetics, exhibiting **seed conformance**.

*   **Animal Order:** The Animal Order encompasses all animals, from insects to mammals. Like the Plant/Bio Order, it possesses **existence, growth,** and **respiration**. However, it also exhibits **consciousness** and **selection**, demonstrated through its ability to make choices based on sensory input. The natural characteristic of the Animal Order is to exhibit both **cruelty and non-cruelty**, reflecting its capacity for both predatory behaviour and nurturing instincts.  This order conforms to its lineage, exhibiting **breed conformance**.

*   **Human Order:**  The Human Order comprises all human beings. Humans share the characteristics of **existence, growth, respiration, consciousness,** and **selection** with the previous orders. However, human consciousness ('I') displays a higher level of complexity, capable of **desire, thought, and a need to know or understand**. This distinguishes humans from animals, who primarily operate based on instinct. The Human Order's innateness is the **"will to live with happiness"**, a drive to not merely survive but to seek fulfillment and well-being. Its natural characteristic is to exhibit values like **perseverance, bravery, and generosity**. It conforms to its learned values and conditioning, referred to as **sanskãra conformance**.

### The Present State of the Human Order: A Critical Examination:

The sources suggest that despite possessing the capacity for understanding and acting in harmony with nature, the current state of the Human Order falls short of its potential. Humans often act in ways that disrupt the balance of the four orders, primarily due to a lack of right understanding.

Here are some key observations from the sources:

*   **Focus on Material Accumulation**:  The sources highlight a dominant tendency in human society to prioritize material accumulation and the maximization of sensory pleasures over the pursuit of right understanding and harmonious living. This "animal consciousness" leads to an obsession with consumption, profit, and sensual gratification, creating a cycle of desire and dissatisfaction. 
*   **Disruption of Natural Harmony:** Instead of recognizing our interconnectedness with the other orders, human activities often exploit and dominate them, leading to consequences like pollution, resource depletion, and climate change. This unsustainable approach stems from a misconception that nature is separate from us and exists solely for our exploitation.
*   **Lack of Self-Regulation**: While the other orders demonstrate self-regulation and balance, the Human Order often struggles to manage its own needs and desires in a sustainable way. This is evident in issues like overpopulation, inequality, conflict, and the pursuit of "growth" that prioritises material gain over ecological well-being.

### Moving Toward a Holistic Participation: The Need for Transformation:

The sources emphasize the need for a transformation within the Human Order, a shift from "animal consciousness" to "human consciousness." This transformation involves:

*   **Developing Right Understanding**: Cultivating an understanding of the interconnectedness of the four orders, the cyclical processes in nature, and the importance of living in harmony with the natural world.
*   **Embracing Universal Human Values**:  Shifting priorities from material accumulation to the cultivation of values like trust, respect, affection, care, and mutual fulfillment in all our relationships, including our relationship with nature.
*   **Adopting Holistic Technologies**: Developing and utilising technologies that work in harmony with nature, minimizing environmental impact, and contributing to the well-being of all orders.
*   **Learning from Nature and Traditional Practices**: Recognizing the wisdom inherent in natural systems and indigenous knowledge systems that have historically coexisted sustainably with nature.

By embracing these principles, the Human Order can fulfill its potential as a conscious and responsible participant in the web of life, contributing to a more sustainable and harmonious future for all beings.

# Q. What do you mean by ‘conformance’? Explain the conformance in the four orders.

## Conformance in the Four Orders of Nature: Ensuring Continuity and Harmony

The sources explain **conformance** as the principle that ensures the continuity and preservation of the fundamental nature of each unit within the four orders of nature: **Material, Plant/Bio (Pranic), Animal, and Human**. It refers to how each unit adheres to a set of inherent principles or laws that govern its existence and interactions within its respective order.

The sources use the term " _anu-sangitã_" to describe this concept, emphasizing that each entity remains consistent with its essential nature and contributes to the overall balance and harmony of the natural world.

### Explaining Conformance in Each Order:

*   **Material Order:** The Material Order exhibits **constitution conformance (_parinãma anu-sangitã_)**, meaning each unit adheres strictly to its inherent physical and chemical properties. This ensures the consistency and predictability of the material world. For instance, every atom of gold will always possess the properties that define it as gold, and water molecules will always conform to their specific chemical composition. This unwavering conformity maintains the stability and integrity of the material world.

*   **Plant/Bio (Pranic) Order:**  This order demonstrates **seed conformance (_bïja anu-sangitã_)**. Every plant carries within its seed the blueprint for its entire life cycle, ensuring the continuity of its species. A mango seed will always give rise to a mango tree, and a rose seed will always produce a rose bush. This inherent faithfulness to its seed ensures the preservation of the diverse forms of life within the Plant/Bio Order.

*   **Animal Order:** The Animal Order displays **breed conformance (_vansa anu-sangitã_)**. Animals inherit their physical characteristics, instincts, and behaviours from their lineage. A cow will always give birth to a calf, and a lion cub will inherit the instincts and traits of its pride. This conformance to breed ensures the continuation of specific animal species and their roles within the ecosystem.

*   **Human Order:** In contrast to the previous orders, humans exhibit **sanskãra conformance (_sanskãra anu-sangitã_)**, meaning they conform to their learned values, beliefs, and conditioning.  While humans possess a biological inheritance like animals, their behaviour and character are largely shaped by upbringing, education, cultural influences, and personal experiences. The sources suggest that this sanskãra conformance makes the Human Order unique, as it introduces a level of flexibility and adaptability not seen in the other orders. However, it also implies that humans have a responsibility to cultivate right understanding and values to ensure their actions contribute to the well-being of themselves and the larger order of existence.

### The Significance of Conformance: Maintaining Order and Enabling Evolution

Conformance plays a crucial role in maintaining order and stability within nature.  It ensures the continuation of species, the predictability of natural processes, and the balance of ecosystems.  However, the concept of conformance also highlights the potential for evolution and adaptation.

*   **Material Order:** While conforming to its inherent properties, the Material Order undergoes continuous transformation through processes like erosion, weathering, and chemical reactions. This constant interplay of elements contributes to the formation of diverse landscapes and geological formations over time.

*   **Plant/Bio Order:** Seed conformance allows for subtle variations and adaptations within plant species, enabling them to thrive in different environments and evolve over generations.

*   **Animal Order:** While conforming to breed, animals also adapt to their surroundings, learning new behaviours and strategies for survival.

*   **Human Order:** Sanskar conformance provides humans with the capacity to learn, grow, and evolve their understanding and values. This potential for conscious evolution distinguishes the Human Order and enables it to play a significant role in shaping the future of the planet.

By understanding the concept of conformance, we can appreciate the interconnectedness and delicate balance within the four orders of nature.  It underscores the importance of respecting the natural world and aligning our actions with the principles of harmony and sustainability.

# Q. What are the four orders in nature? Describe in detail about their activities and natural characteristics?

## A Detailed Examination of the Four Orders in Nature

The sources describe a framework for understanding nature and the interconnectedness of its elements by categorising nature into four distinct **orders**: Material, Plant/Bio (Pranic), Animal, and Human.  Each order is characterised by specific activities and natural characteristics that define its role and participation in the larger web of existence.

### 1. Material Order (padãrtha avasthã)

This order encompasses the most fundamental building blocks of nature, including:

*   Soil
*   Air
*   Water
*   Metals
*   Various forms of energy (like sound, light, heat, magnetism, and gravitational energy)

#### Activities:

The primary activity of the Material Order is **composition and decomposition**. This refers to the continuous process of:

*   **Composition**: Units coming together to form larger units. For example, atoms combining to form molecules, or molecules forming molecular structures.
*   **Decomposition**: Larger units breaking down into smaller units. This could include the weathering of rocks, the breakdown of organic matter, or the release of energy during nuclear fission.

This order does not experience "growth" in a biological sense, but instead undergoes constant transformation through these processes. 

#### Natural Characteristic:

The sources identify the natural characteristic or *svabhãva* of the Material Order as **supportive**. This order provides the essential elements necessary for the existence of the other orders. For example, the material order provides:

*   Nutrients to the Plant/Bio Order in the form of soil and minerals
*   The basis for movement for animals, birds, and fish
*   Water, oxygen, and other gases necessary for the survival of plants and animals

#### Conformance:

The Material Order exhibits **constitution conformance** (*parinãm anusangï*), meaning each unit adheres strictly to its inherent physical and chemical properties. For instance, every atom of iron will always possess the characteristics that define it as iron. This unwavering conformity maintains the stability and integrity of the material world.

#### Innateness:

The innateness (*dhãranã*) of the Material Order is **existence**.  This means that matter cannot be destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. The fundamental particles that constitute matter will always continue to exist, even if their form or arrangement changes.

### 2. Plant/Bio Order (prãn.a  avasthã)

This order includes a wide range of life forms:

*   Single-celled organisms (like fungi and algae)
*   Plants
*   Trees
*   Vegetation in the ocean

#### Activities:

The Plant/Bio Order inherits the activities of **composition** and **decomposition** from the Material Order and additionally exhibits:

*   **Growth**: Plants have an inherent capacity to increase in size and complexity over time.
*   **Respiration**: Plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, a process essential for their own survival and the balance of the atmosphere.

#### Natural Characteristic:

The natural characteristic of the Plant/Bio Order is to **nurture or worsen** (*Poshana/Apaposhana*). This order provides:

*   Food and oxygen for animals and humans
*   Contributes to the regulation of ecosystems through processes like photosynthesis and nutrient cycling
*   Enriches the soil through decomposition, providing nutrients for new growth

However, depending on the context of its interaction, this order can also have negative effects. For example:

*   Excess consumption of certain plant products can harm the human body
*   Some plants are poisonous to animals

#### Conformance:

This order demonstrates **seed conformance** (*bïja anu-sangitã*). Every plant carries within its seed the blueprint for its entire life cycle. For example, a mango seed will always give rise to a mango tree. This ensures the continuation of specific plant species and their roles within the larger ecosystem.

#### Innateness:

The Plant/Bio Order possesses the innateness of **existence** and **growth**. As long as a plant exists, it will continue to grow and participate in the cyclical processes of life. 

### 3. Animal Order (jïva avasthã)

This order encompasses all animals, from insects to mammals. 

#### Activities:

Like the Plant/Bio Order, the Animal Order carries out the activities of **composition, decomposition, growth**, and **respiration**. In addition, it exhibits:

*   **Consciousness:**  Animals are aware of their surroundings and can respond to stimuli in their environment.
*   **Selection:** Based on their consciousness, animals have a basic capacity to make choices, primarily driven by instinct and a need for survival.

#### Natural Characteristic:

The natural characteristic of the Animal Order is to exhibit both **cruelty** (*krüratã*) and **non-cruelty** (*akrüratã*). This reflects the dual nature of animals:

*   Predatory animals exhibit cruelty through their hunting and feeding behaviours.
*   Animals also display nurturing instincts, caring for their young and cooperating within their social groups.

The balance between these characteristics varies across different species, with some animals predominantly exhibiting one over the other.

#### Conformance:

The Animal Order displays **breed conformance** (*vansa anu-sangitã*). Animals inherit their physical characteristics, instincts, and behaviours from their lineage. For example, a cow will always give birth to a calf, inheriting the characteristics of its species. This conformance to breed ensures the continuation of specific animal species and their roles within the ecosystem.

#### Innateness:

The Animal Order inherits the innateness of **existence** and **growth** from the Plant/Bio Order. Additionally, it possesses the **will to live** or " *jïne kï % %asa* ". This intrinsic drive for survival motivates animals to seek food, shelter, and protection from threats, ensuring the continuation of their species.

### 4. Human Order (gyãna avasthã)

This order is comprised of all human beings. 

#### Activities:

Humans share the activities of **composition, decomposition, growth, respiration, consciousness**, and **selection** with the previous orders. However, what distinguishes the Human Order is the complex nature of its consciousness ('I'), which possesses:

*   **Desire:** Humans have the capacity to formulate wants and aspirations that motivate their actions, often extending beyond basic survival needs.
*   **Thought:**  Humans can engage in complex cognitive processes, including reasoning, planning, and problem-solving, which allow them to interact with the world in more sophisticated ways.
*   **Need to Know**:  In addition to making choices based on instinct or sensory input, humans also possess a natural curiosity and a drive to understand the world around them. This "need to know" motivates humans to seek knowledge, explore their surroundings, and contemplate their existence.

#### Natural Characteristic:

The natural characteristic of the Human Order is to exhibit values such as:

*   **Perseverance** (*dhïratã*): A commitment to pursuing goals and overcoming obstacles, driven by an understanding of the interconnectedness and harmony of existence. 
*   **Bravery** (*vïratã*):  The willingness to face challenges and act in accordance with one's understanding, even in the face of fear or adversity.
*   **Generosity** (*udãratã*): Recognizing the importance of sharing resources and knowledge to ensure the well-being of others and contributing to the overall harmony of society and nature.
*   **Kindness, Benevolence, and Compassion**: These values, naturally acceptable to humans, emphasize care, empathy, and a desire to alleviate suffering in others.

The sources suggest that living in accordance with these values aligns human behaviour with its natural characteristic and leads to a state of individual and collective well-being.

#### Conformance:

Humans exhibit **sanskãra conformance** (*sanskãra anu-sangitã*), meaning they conform to their learned values, beliefs, and conditioning.  This makes the Human Order unique, as its behaviour is not solely determined by biological inheritance but is heavily influenced by factors such as:

*   Upbringing
*   Education
*   Cultural influences
*   Personal experiences

While this sanskãra conformance allows for flexibility and adaptability, it also means humans have a responsibility to cultivate right understanding and values that contribute to a harmonious existence.

#### Innateness:

The Human Order inherits the innateness of **existence** and **growth** from the previous orders. However, its defining innateness is the **will to live with happiness**. This inherent desire for fulfillment and well-being motivates humans to seek not just survival but also a life of meaning and purpose.

The sources emphasize that understanding these four orders, their interconnectedness, and the principles that govern their interactions is crucial for achieving individual and collective well-being and ensuring a sustainable future for all beings.

## Co-existence of Units in Nature Submerged in Space: A Detailed Chart and Your Role in Existence

Here is a chart depicting the different categories of units in nature in co-existence within space, based on the detailed descriptions provided in the sources:

### Chart: Co-existence of Units in Nature Submerged in Space

| Attribute          | Units (Nature)                                                                                                    | Space (All-Pervading)                                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Size              | **Limited** ( *sïmit*) - Ranges from small (atom) to large (galaxies), but always finite and bounded on six sides | **Unlimited** ( *asïmit*) - Not bounded on any side; no beginning or end; all-pervading ( *vyãpaka*)                      |
| Activity          | **Active** ( *kriyãsïl*) - Exhibits various forms of activity (physical, physico-chemical, or conscious)             | **No-Activity** ( *kriyã sünya* = *sünya*) -  Activity only occurs within the units; space itself is devoid of activity     |
| Energy            | **Energized** ( *ürjit*) - Possesses a specific energy level based on its composition and interactions               | **Energy in Equilibrium** ( *sãmya ürjã*) - Provides a constant, balanced energy field in which all units are submerged |
| Relationships     | **Recognizes and Fulfills Relationships** (*parasparatã ko pahachãnanã, nirvãha karanã*) - Interacts with other units in a defined manner, contributing to the overall harmony | **Reflecting and Transparent** ( *pãradarsï*) - Allows units to reflect in each other, enabling them to recognize and establish relationships |
| Organization     | **Self-Organized** ( *niyantrit*) - Maintains its own internal order and structure                               | **Self-Organization is Available** ( *niyantran upalabdha*) - Provides the conditions for self-organization within the units |

### Categories of Units

The chart further classifies units into two main categories:

#### 1. Material or *jadâ* Units

*   Includes all units belonging to the **Material Order** and **Plant/Bio Order** (e.g., soil, water, air, plants, trees).
*   Engages only in the activities of **recognizing** and **fulfilling** relationships.
*   **Temporary** in nature (*gathansïla*) - Undergo constant structural changes (composition and decomposition).
*   Examples: Stones, minerals, water, plant cells, animal bodies, human bodies.

#### 2. Conscious or *chaitanya* Units

*   Comprises the **Self ('I')** present in the **Animal Order** and **Human Order**.
*   Possesses the activities of **knowing, assuming, recognizing**, and **fulfilling** relationships.
*   **Continuous** in nature (*gathanpurna*) - Do not undergo structural changes but experience qualitative changes through learning and development.
*   Examples: The conscious awareness ('I') in animals and humans.

### Your Role in Existence: Understanding and Living in Harmony

The sources highlight that your primary role in existence is not to create or control, but to **understand and live in harmony**. This involves several key aspects:

1.  **Realizing Co-existence:** Acknowledging the interconnectedness of all units within space and the inherent harmony that exists within this interconnected web. 
2.  **Living in Harmony with Nature:** Recognizing your relationship with all four orders of nature and ensuring mutual fulfillment within those relationships. This means contributing to the well-being of other beings and minimizing harm to the natural world.
3.  **Cultivating Right Understanding:** Engaging in self-exploration to verify the principles of co-existence and to develop the knowledge of Self (*jïvana gyãna*) and the knowledge of Existence (*astitva darshana gyãna*). This understanding forms the basis for ethical human conduct (*mãnavïyatã* & *pürna acharana gyãna*) and allows you to live in accordance with your natural characteristic (*svabhãva*).

By fulfilling this role, you contribute to the completion of the universal order, both within yourself and within the larger web of existence. This leads to a state of individual and collective well-being, characterized by happiness, mutual fulfillment, and sustainable co-existence.
