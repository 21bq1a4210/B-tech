Let's go through each concept and line of code in the given `BinarySearch` class:
### 1. Class Definition:
```python
class BinarySearch:
```
This line defines the class `BinarySearch`.

### 2. Constructor Method:
```python
    def __init__(self, arr, key):
        self.arr = arr
        self.key = key
        BinarySearch.search(self)
```
The `__init__` method is the constructor method of the class. It is called when an instance of the class is created. The constructor takes two parameters: `arr` and `key`. It assigns the `arr` and `key` values to the instance variables `self.arr` and `self.key` respectively. It then calls the `BinarySearch.search()` method, passing `self` as an argument.

### 3. Search Method (Static Method):
```python
    @staticmethod
    def search(self):
```
This line decorates the `search` method as a static method. Static methods belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class. They can be called using the class name.

### 4. Variable Initialization:
```python
        low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
```
This line initializes the variables `low` and `high`. `low` is set to 0, and `high` is set to the index of the last element in the `arr` list.

### 5. Binary Search Loop:
```python
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if key == arr[mid]:
                print(f"element found at {mid + 1}")
                break
            elif key > arr[mid]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        else:
            print("element not found")
```
This block of code implements the binary search algorithm. It continues searching for the `key` value in the sorted `arr` list until `low` becomes greater than `high`. 

Inside the loop, the code calculates the `mid` index as the average of `low` and `high` (integer division). It then compares the `key` value with the element at the `mid` index. If they are equal, it prints the position where the element was found and breaks out of the loop. If the `key` value is greater than the element at the `mid` index, the `low` index is updated to `mid + 1`. If the `key` value is less than the element at the `mid` index, the `high` index is updated to `mid - 1`.

If the loop completes without finding the `key` value, it prints "element not found".

### 6. User Input:
```python
arr = list(map(int, input("enter elements:").split()))
key = int(input("enter key:"))
```
These two lines prompt the user to enter the elements of the list separated by spaces. It then converts the input into a list of integers using the `map` function and `int` type casting. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `arr`. The user is also prompted to enter the `key` value, which is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `key`.

### 7. Object Creation:
```python
obj = BinarySearch(arr, key)
```
This line creates an instance of the `BinarySearch` class, passing the `arr` and `key` values as arguments to the constructor. The resulting object is assigned to the variable `obj`.

This code aims to perform a binary search on the `arr` list for the `key` value and print the result.
