# Classifications of Energy

The sources discuss **energy**, defining it as the **ability to perform work**—specifically, the ability to move an object against a resistant force.  The scientific unit for measuring energy is the joule. The sources explain that the concept of energy links processes such as fuel combustion, machine propulsion, and battery charging. 

The sources provide two ways to classify energy:

*   **Kinetic Energy:** The energy an object possesses due to its motion. The sources further break down kinetic energy into:

    *   **Mechanical Energy:** The energy of objects in motion, like a moving car or a spinning turbine.
    *   **Thermal Energy:** The energy produced by the movement of particles within an object. Thermal energy is experienced as heat.
    *   **Electrical Energy:** The energy generated by the movement of electrons or charged particles, used to power devices.
    *   **Radiant Energy:** The energy carried by electromagnetic waves, such as sunlight and X-rays.
    *   **Sound Energy:** The energy transmitted by sound waves, produced by vibrating objects.

*   **Potential Energy:** The energy stored within an object based on its position or state. This is further categorised into:

    *   **Gravitational Energy:** The energy an object holds due to its position within a gravitational field. For instance, water held in a dam possesses gravitational energy which can be harnessed to generate electricity.
    *   **Elastic Energy:** The energy stored when objects are stretched or compressed, such as a spring or a rubber band.
    *   **Chemical Energy:** The energy stored in the chemical bonds of a substance, which is released during chemical reactions. Examples include batteries and fossil fuels.

## Energy Efficiency and Pollution Control in Green Buildings

The sources connect energy efficiency and pollution control, especially in the context of green buildings. They explain that a core principle of green buildings is to minimise their environmental impact, and achieving energy efficiency plays a crucial role in this objective. By reducing energy consumption, green buildings contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution associated with energy production.  

### Strategies for Energy Efficiency in Buildings

The sources outline various strategies for enhancing energy efficiency in buildings:

*   **Design and Orientation:**  Optimising the building's design and orientation to maximise natural light and reduce reliance on artificial lighting. Using passive solar design principles to harness natural heat and ventilation, incorporating shading devices to minimise direct sunlight, and reducing cooling loads are highlighted as key considerations.
*   **Energy-Efficient Lighting:** Installing energy-efficient lighting systems like LEDs, which consume less energy and have a longer lifespan than traditional incandescent bulbs. Using occupancy sensors and daylight sensors to adjust lighting levels automatically based on occupancy and natural light availability are also mentioned.
*   **Heat and Cooling Systems:** Employing high-efficiency HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems that meet or exceed energy efficiency standards. Incorporating occupancy sensors, variable-speed drives, automated ventilation control, heat exchangers, and efficient motors to reduce energy consumption by regulating heating and cooling levels to maintain a comfortable and healthy environment.
*   **Insulation and Sealing:** Properly insulating the building envelope (walls, roof, and windows) is crucial to minimise heat transfer and improve energy efficiency. Sealing air leaks and using weather stripping are essential to prevent drafts and enhance thermal comfort.
*   **Renewable Energy Sources:** Integrating renewable energy systems like solar panels or wind turbines for electricity generation is encouraged. Incorporating geothermal systems for heating and cooling, utilising the earth's consistent temperature. The sources also mention hydropower and biomass as potential renewable energy options for green buildings.

*   **Water Pollution:** Fossil fuel extraction and processing can contaminate water sources through oil spills, chemical leaks, and runoff. Energy efficiency decreases the demand for fossil fuels, lessening the risks associated with their extraction and transportation.
*   **Climate Change:** Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion are a major driver of climate change. Energy efficiency helps reduce carbon emissions, mitigating the impacts of climate change.

###  Low Energy Design

The sources highlight the concept of "low energy design," a comprehensive approach to building design and construction that prioritises minimising energy consumption throughout the building's lifecycle.  They explain that low-energy buildings achieve this by:

*   Employing a combination of passive techniques (related to the building's shape and materials) and active systems (machinery for building services).
*   Reducing reliance on mechanical heating and cooling through effective insulation, natural ventilation, and passive heating and cooling strategies.
*   Integrating renewable energy technologies to meet remaining energy needs.

The sources present various principles of low energy design:

*   Integrating energy concepts from the project's initial stages.
*   Optimising building shape to minimise energy requirements.
