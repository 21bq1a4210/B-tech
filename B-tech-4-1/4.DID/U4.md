Their familiarity and **tactile feedback** make them very efficient for data input. Though heavily criticised over the years, the keyboard is a very successful device, and billions of people use it. 

### Keyboard and Keypad Usage 

* **Keyboards** are generally used for tasks like:
    * Document composition 
    * Email communication
    * Issuing commands
* **Keypads** are generally used for smaller devices like: 
    * Mobile phones 
    * Calculators 

### Keyboard and Keypad Design

The design of keyboards and keypads involves a lot of careful consideration and testing to optimise their form and function. Some important design considerations include: 

* **Layout and Physical Design:** 
    * The layout of keys is **crucial for user experience**. 
        * **QWERTY** is the most common layout, but layouts should be adapted for different languages and use cases.
        * There is still controversy about the design of **number pads**, with telephones and calculators using different layouts. 
    * The **size, spacing, and positioning** of keys must be carefully considered to ensure a comfortable and seamless user experience. 
        * These factors impact the user's ability to input data efficiently. 
    * Designers must consider **ergonomic design** to minimise user discomfort, especially during prolonged use. 
        * Alternative geometries like **split and tilted keyboards** have been tried, but empirical evidence of their benefits is limited.
* **Accessible Text Entry:** 
    * Designers must consider **accessibility** for users with different needs. 
        * This includes people with motor impairments and visually impaired users.
    * Some accessible text entry methods include:
        * **Adaptive keyboards** with lowered keys
        * **On-screen keyboards** accessed with alternative input devices like:
            * Head pointers
            * Oversized trackballs
        * **Dictionary-based auto-completion** and automatic error correction
        * **Non-visual input methods** like: 
            * **PerkInput** 
            * **BrailleTouch**
        * **Dasher**: Predicts characters and words and can be used with brain-computer interfaces. 
        * **orbiTouch's Keyless Keyboard**: Replaces keys with two inverted bowls and requires only small hand movements.
        * **Pointing devices** like mice, touchpads and eye-trackers 
        * **Wearable devices** like wristbands and rings 
        * **Speech input**
* **Mobile Text Entry:**

    * Designers have developed various techniques to address these constraints. 
    * Some text entry methods used for mobile devices include:
        * **Multi-tap**: Requires multiple taps on a key to cycle through letters, with pauses necessary between consecutive letters.
        * **Predictive techniques** such as:
            * **T9®** 
            * **LetterWise**:  Uses probabilities of prefixes and allows the entry of non-dictionary words.
        * **Physical QWERTY keyboards**: Still preferred by some mobile users, especially those who enter a lot of text. 
        * **Soft keyboards**: Virtual keyboards displayed on the touchscreen. 
            * The benefit of soft keyboards is that they can be dynamically relabelled and resized to fit different character sets, layouts, and device orientations. 
            * Because they lack tactile feedback, soft keyboards are difficult to use for eyes-free operation and generally have lower performance. 
        * **Projection keyboards**: Project an image of a keyboard onto a surface. 
        * **Word completion suggestions**
        * **Language models** that predict words based on the current sentence 
        * **Swype** and **ShapeWriter**: Allow users to trace letters with a single gesture, using language models to resolve conflicts. 
        * **The Shift technique**: Helps mitigate the "fat finger" problem by displacing the screen content based on the user's touch. 
        * **Handwriting recognition**: Particularly promising for languages like Japanese and Chinese, but may be difficult for users with motor control issues. 
            * **Graffiti®** 
            * **EdgeWrite**: Uses a physical border and a modified character set to improve accuracy. 
        * **ZoomBoard**: Uses iterative zooming to make small keys usable on small displays. 
        * **Shorthand gesturing** 
* **Key Design:**
    * Keys are typically designed with:
        * **Concave surfaces** for good fingertip contact
        * A **matte finish** to reduce glare and finger slips
    * They require a specific force and displacement to activate, enabling rapid typing with few errors and providing feedback. 
        * **Tactile and audible feedback** are important in touch typing. 
    * **Larger keys** are used for frequently-used keys such as the: 
        * Space bar
        * Enter key 
        * Shift key
        * Ctrl key
    * Some keys, such as:
        * Caps Lock
        * Num Lock
    * ...should clearly indicate their state (for example, through an embedded light). 
    * **Large-print keyboards** are available for visually impaired users. 
* **Cursor Movement Keys:** 
    * The placement of cursor-movement keys is important for efficient and error-free use. 
    * Common cursor key arrangements include:
        * The **inverted-T** arrangement:  Allows for reduced hand and finger movement.
        * The **cross arrangement**: A good choice for new users. 
    * On some large keyboards, the numerical keypad keys are reused for diagonal movements, toggled by the Num Lock key. 
    * Some applications (such as games) reassign letter keys (often **WASD**) as cursor-movement keys to minimise finger motion.
* **Key Mapping and Shortcuts**: 
    * **Intuitive shortcuts** and customisation options improve user experience and efficiency.
    * Well-designed shortcuts can speed up common tasks, improving usability.

### The QWERTY Keyboard Layout

The QWERTY keyboard layout, designed by **Christopher Latham Sholes** in the 1870s, remains the dominant keyboard layout today.

* **Sholes's design** was successful because of its:
    * Good mechanical design
    * Clever placement of letters that slowed users down enough to prevent key jamming 
    * In this layout, frequently used letter pairs are far apart, increasing finger travel distances. 
* Despite its drawbacks, the success of **QWERTY** led to widespread standardisation. 
* The development of electronic keyboards eliminated the mechanical issues of typewriters, leading to the proposal of alternative layouts like **Dvorak**.
    * While these alternative layouts could improve typing speed and reduce errors, they failed to gain traction due to the effort required to learn a new, non-standard interface. 

The sources also discuss the **ABCDE keyboard layout**, which has letters in alphabetical order, and its limited effectiveness. They also cover **chorded keyboards** such as **stenotypes**, which allow for faster text entry but require extensive training.

### Concluding Thoughts

The evolution of keyboard and keypad technology has been driven by a focus on improving usability and efficiency. Designers continue to explore new layouts, designs, and input methods, especially in the context of mobile devices and accessibility.

# View (Window) Management: Organising Information for Efficiency

The sources emphasize that effective **view (window) management** is crucial for user productivity and satisfaction, particularly when users need to consult multiple documents, forms, or applications to complete their tasks. The goal is to **minimise window-housekeeping actions** and **reduce distracting clutter** while providing users with the information and flexibility they need.

### The Evolution of Window Management

Window design has evolved significantly, moving from early, limited systems to the now-prevalent **overlapping, draggable, and resizable windows on a broad desktop**. This paradigm, pioneered by Xerox PARC and popularised by Apple and Microsoft, has become the standard for most users. Advanced features like **workspaces** or **rooms** allow users to switch between collections of windows, preserving the state of each window for easy resumption of activity.

### The Need for Coordinated Windows

The sources argue that the next generation of window managers should focus on **coordinated windows**. These windows would **appear, change contents, resize automatically, and close in response to user actions within the task domain**, minimising the need for manual window management.

#### Examples of Coordinated Window Actions

The sources provide several examples of how coordinated windows could streamline user workflows:

*   In a medical insurance claims processing application, opening a client's file could automatically populate relevant fields and simultaneously open windows displaying the client's medical history, previous claims, and a payment form. Scrolling through the medical history window could synchronise scrolling in the previous claims window to show related information. Completing the claim could then automatically save all window contents and close all windows with a single action.
*   A job seeker browsing online could select multiple job descriptions and open them in separate windows with one click. Synchronised scrolling would allow for easy comparison of job details. Selecting a preferred position could then maximise that window while automatically closing the others.

### Coordination Techniques for Enhanced User Experience

The sources outline several **coordination techniques** that can enhance window management and improve user experience:

*   **Synchronised scrolling**: Linking the scroll bars of multiple windows allows for simultaneous scrolling, facilitating comparison of documents or code. Synchronisation can be line-by-line, proportional, or keyed to matching elements in the windows.
*   **Hierarchical browsing**: This technique uses coordinated windows to represent hierarchical structures, such as a book's table of contents and its chapters. Selecting an item in the hierarchy automatically displays the corresponding content in a linked window. Examples include Windows File Explorer for browsing directories and Microsoft Outlook for navigating email folders.
*   **Opening/closing of dependent windows**: This approach automatically opens and closes related windows based on user actions. For example, opening a main software procedure in a development environment could automatically open windows displaying dependent procedures. Completing a task could then automatically close all associated windows.
*   **Saving/opening of window state**: This feature saves and restores the entire display state, including window positions, sizes, and contents, providing a seamless way to resume work.
*   **Tabbed browsing**: This method, commonly used in web browsers, allows users to view multiple pages within a single window, simplifying navigation and reducing clutter.
*   **Tiled or overlapping windows**: Windows can be automatically arranged to avoid overlap, improving visibility and organization.
*   **Ribbon interface**: This interface, popularised by Microsoft Office, groups related commands and features in a visually prominent and easily accessible ribbon, streamlining access to commonly used functions.
*   **Design patterns**: Employing established design patterns can promote consistency and usability across different applications and platforms.
*   **Start menus**: A well-designed start menu, like the Windows Start menu, provides a central point for launching applications, accessing settings, and finding files, simplifying system navigation.

The sources suggest that **careful study of user tasks** is essential for developing effective task-specific coordinations based on typical sequences of actions.

### Browsing Large Views: Special Considerations

When working with large images or diagrams, **coordinated windows** can facilitate navigation and exploration. One common approach involves using two linked windows: an **overview** window displaying the entire image and a **detail** window showing a magnified portion. Moving a field-of-view box in the overview window dynamically updates the content displayed in the detail window. Conversely, panning within the detail window moves the field-of-view box in the overview window.

#### Optimising Large View Browsing

For optimal usability, the field-of-view box and detail view should have **matching aspect ratios**, with changes to one automatically reflected in the other. **Zoom factors** between 5 and 30 are generally effective. However, for larger zoom factors, intermediate views may be necessary to preserve user orientation. For example, when zooming from a world map to a street-level view of Paris, intermediate views of Europe and France would be helpful.

The sources also discuss alternative approaches to large view browsing:

*   **Single view with zooming**: This method replaces the overview with the detail view as the user zooms in, maximizing screen space for each view but sacrificing the simultaneous overview.
*   **Overlapping detail view**: This technique partially overlays the detail view onto the overview, potentially obscuring key elements.
*   **Semantic zooming**: This approach changes the representation of objects based on their magnification, potentially improving overview comprehension during rapid zooming in and out.

### Fisheye Views: Exploring Focus and Context

**Fisheye views** attempt to provide both detail and context without obscuring any information by using distortion techniques. The area of interest is magnified, while the surrounding context remains visible but distorted. While visually compelling, fisheye views can be disorienting due to the constantly changing magnification. Additionally, zoom factors in published examples are typically limited to 5.

One successful application of the fisheye view concept is the **Mac OS X Dock**, where scrolling over an icon magnifies it, highlighting its readiness for selection.

### Tailoring Image Browsers to User Tasks

The sources stress that the design of image browsers should be driven by the users' tasks, which can be broadly categorized as:

*   Image generation
*   Open-ended exploration
*   Diagnostics
*   Navigation
*   Monitoring

Users perform various low-level actions within these high-level tasks, such as moving the focus, comparing regions, traversing paths, and marking locations for later reference. Understanding these actions informs the design of effective image browsing interfaces.

*   **User Control**: Users should be able to control the animation's playback, including pausing, skipping, or replaying. This gives users agency and prevents them from feeling rushed.
*   **Careful Timing**:  The timing and speed of animations should be carefully considered and tested.  For example, a slow, smooth animation for an alert can convey calmness, while a fast, abrupt animation can communicate urgency.

### Potential Drawbacks of Animation

The sources also acknowledge that animation can have drawbacks if not implemented carefully:

*   **Distraction and Frustration**: Excessive or gratuitous animations can distract users and hinder interaction. Animations that are too slow to load, particularly on websites, can lead to frustration and abandonment.
*   **Overuse of Parallax Scrolling**: While parallax scrolling can create a visually appealing 3D effect, it can also be distracting if overused, especially on smaller screens.
*   **Limited Effectiveness in Explaining Complex Processes**: The sources note that there are doubts about the effectiveness of animation in explaining complex processes, although creating the animation itself may have educational value.

### Animation Trends and Examples

The sources point to several trends and examples related to animation in user interface design:

*   **Gapminder's Use of Animation**: The Gapminder application, which visualizes global development trends, provides an excellent example of how animation can be used effectively to present statistical data and tell compelling stories.
*   **Prezi's Zooming Presentations**: Prezi leverages zooming animations to create engaging and dynamic presentations, demonstrating the potential of animation for storytelling and knowledge sharing.
*   **Growth of Animation in Web Design**: Modern webpage designs often incorporate more animation, including animated GIFs, video links, and dynamic, real-time updates.

# Colour in Interface Design

The sources highlight the use of **colour** as a powerful design element that can significantly enhance the user experience, but also caution against its misuse. Colour can evoke emotional responses, facilitate information discrimination, and improve task performance. However, improper use of colour can lead to confusion, distraction, and hinder usability.

### Guidelines for Effective Colour Use

The sources offer a comprehensive set of guidelines to ensure effective and appropriate use of colour in interface design:

*   **Use Colour Conservatively**: Avoid overwhelming the user with an excessive number of colours.  Too many colours can be visually jarring and make it difficult to discern meaningful relationships.
*   **Limit the Number of Colours**:  A general guideline is to limit the number of colours in a single display to four, with a maximum of seven colours across a sequence of displays. Experienced users may tolerate more colours, but novice users can easily become overwhelmed. 
*   **Support the Task**: Ensure that the colour coding scheme aligns with the user's tasks. For example, in an accounting application, highlighting overdue accounts in red would support the task of identifying late payments. However, if the task shifts to locating accounts with balances over a certain amount, the red colour coding might hinder the new task. 
*   **Minimise User Effort**: Colour coding should be applied automatically, whenever relevant to the user's current task, to minimise the cognitive load on the user. Users should not have to manually activate or deactivate colour coding for each task. 
*   **User Control**:  Provide users with the option to turn off colour coding if they find it distracting or unhelpful. This is particularly important for features like spell checkers that highlight potential errors in colour. 
*   **Design for Monochrome First**:  Establish a clear and logical layout in monochrome before introducing colour. Use spacing, indentation, grouping, and other visual cues to organise the information effectively. Colour should then be used to enhance the existing structure, not create it. 
*   **Consider Colour-Deficient Users**: Be mindful of users with colour vision deficiencies. Avoid colour combinations that are difficult to distinguish for these users, such as red and green. Provide alternative colour palettes or allow users to customise the colours to suit their needs.  Tools like Vischeck and ColorBrewer can help designers select appropriate colour schemes. 
*   **Help with Formatting**: Use colour to group related items, particularly in densely packed displays where space is limited. For example, in a police dispatcher's display, colour could differentiate emergency calls from routine calls, allowing for quick assessment of available resources.  
*   **Consistency is Key**: Maintain consistent colour coding throughout the system.  Using the same colour to represent the same meaning across different displays prevents confusion and ensures a predictable user experience.  
*   **Cultural and Domain-Specific Expectations**: Be aware of common cultural or domain-specific interpretations of colour. For instance, red is often associated with danger or stop, while green signifies go or safety.  Consider these expectations when designing colour coding schemes.
*   **Avoid Problematic Pairings**: Some colour combinations, such as red and blue or yellow and purple, can be visually jarring and difficult to read. These combinations can strain the user's eyes and make it challenging to focus on the information. Ensure sufficient contrast between colours to maintain readability.  
*   **Indicate Status Changes**: Use colour changes to signal changes in status or important events.  For example, a pressure gauge in an industrial setting might change colour when a reading exceeds safe limits.  This technique draws attention to critical information and can improve safety. 
*   **Enhance Information Density in Graphic Displays**:  Colour can be used effectively in graphs and diagrams to represent different data sets or highlight specific information.  For example, architectural plans might use colour coding to distinguish electrical wiring from plumbing.

### Benefits of Colour

The sources list several benefits of using colour in interface design:

*   **Aesthetic Appeal**: Colour can make displays more visually appealing and engaging for users. 
*   **Enhanced Information Discrimination**:  Colour can help users quickly distinguish different types of information or identify important elements. 
*   **Improved Task Performance**:  Colour coding can speed up recognition and task completion times, particularly for tasks that involve searching or comparing information.
*   **Emotional Impact**: Colour can evoke emotions and influence user perceptions. For example, warm colours like red and orange can convey energy and excitement, while cool colours like blue and green can evoke calmness and trust.

### Dangers of Colour Misuse

While colour can be a valuable design element, the sources also warn against its misuse:

*   **Distraction and Confusion**:  Too many colours or poorly chosen colour combinations can distract users and make it difficult to focus on the task at hand.  
*   **Accessibility Issues**:  Colour-deficient users may not be able to perceive certain colour combinations, leading to usability problems. 
*   **Inconsistent Meaning**:  Using the same colour to represent different things in different parts of the interface can create confusion and erode user trust.  

The sources emphasize that thorough testing is essential to ensure the effectiveness and usability of any colour scheme. Designers should solicit feedback from users and iterate on their designs based on this feedback.

# ## Understanding Non-anthropomorphic Design

The sources caution against designing interfaces that present computers as human-like entities, advocating instead for a **non-anthropomorphic approach that prioritizes clarity, user control, and a focus on the user's tasks.**

### The Appeal and Pitfalls of Anthropomorphism

While anthropomorphic design, imbuing computers with human-like qualities, might initially appear engaging, the sources argue that it can ultimately be **detrimental to the user experience**. 

*   **False Expectations and Disappointment:** Attributing human-like intelligence, autonomy, or understanding to computers can mislead users about their actual capabilities, leading to disappointment and frustration when the illusion breaks down. 
*   **Blurring Boundaries:**  Anthropomorphic interfaces can blur the distinction between human-computer interaction and interpersonal relationships. This blurring can be unsettling for some users, particularly those who value a clear separation between themselves and technology. 
*   **Anxiety and Distraction:**  Some users, especially those with computer anxiety, may find anthropomorphic interfaces intimidating or distracting.  The sources suggest that a focus on functionality and user control may be more conducive to user acceptance than attempts to create artificial "friendships" with technology.
*   **Ineffectiveness of Imitation:** The sources challenge the assumption that human-human communication serves as an appropriate model for human-computer interaction. They argue that mimicking human behavior can often be counterproductive, leading to awkward or unnatural interactions.

### Historical Examples of Anthropomorphic Design Failures

The sources cite several examples of failed anthropomorphic interfaces, highlighting the persistent allure and ultimate downfall of this approach:

*   **Tillie the Teller, Harvey Wallbanker, and BOB:** These anthropomorphic bank tellers, despite their initial novelty, were ultimately rejected by users.
*   **Talking Automobiles and Soda Machines:** Attempts to imbue these everyday objects with human-like speech were largely unsuccessful.
*   **Postal Buddy:** This ambitious project, aimed at creating a friendly, interactive postal kiosk, failed to gain user acceptance despite its significant cost.
*   **Microsoft BOB and Clippy:**  These software assistants, designed with cartoon-like personalities, were met with mixed reactions, with many users finding them more annoying than helpful.

### Guidelines for Non-anthropomorphic Design

The sources offer specific guidelines for creating interfaces that avoid anthropomorphism and prioritize user-centered design:

*   **Focus on Functionality:** Instead of attempting to simulate human behavior, concentrate on providing clear and concise information about the system's functions. 
*   **User Control:**  Empower users to control the interface and guide their own experience. Avoid interfaces that feel overly directive or intrusive. 
*   **Neutral Language:**  Avoid using first-person pronouns ("I") when referring to the computer system. Use a third-person perspective or neutral phrasing to maintain a clear separation. 
*   **Avoid Judgemental Tone:**  Error messages and feedback should be informative and helpful, not critical or condescending. 
*   **Appropriate Use of Human Guides:**  While anthropomorphic characters should generally be avoided, the sources acknowledge the potential value of using real human beings for introductions or guidance. For instance, a video message from a company CEO could personalize a website without resorting to artificial characters.

### Conclusion: Prioritizing User Needs Over Anthropomorphic Gimmicks

The sources emphasize the importance of designing interfaces that are **comprehensible, predictable, and user-controlled.**  They advocate for a non-anthropomorphic approach that prioritizes functionality, clarity, and user empowerment. While the allure of anthropomorphism persists, designers should prioritize meeting the real needs of users over implementing gimmicks that may ultimately hinder their experience.  

---

# ## Guidelines for Creating Effective Error Messages

The sources emphasise the importance of well-designed error messages in enhancing user experience and reducing frustration. They offer specific guidelines for crafting error messages that are informative, helpful, and user-friendly:

### Specificity: Providing Clear and Targeted Information

Error messages should be specific and precise, providing users with a clear understanding of the problem. Vague or general messages, such as "SYNTAX ERROR" or "INVALID DATA", leave users guessing about the nature of the error and how to rectify it. 

**Examples of Improvements:**

*   **Poor:** SYNTAX ERROR
    **Better:** Unmatched left parenthesis
*   **Poor:** INVALID DATA
    **Better:** Days range from 1 to 31
*   **Poor:** BAD FILE NAME
    **Better:** The file C:\demo\data.txt was not found

### Constructive Guidance and Positive Tone: Empowering Users to Take Action

Error messages should guide users towards a solution, rather than simply condemning their actions. Instead of focusing on what went wrong, messages should indicate how to fix the problem.  A positive and helpful tone can reduce user anxiety and facilitate problem-solving.

**Examples of Improvements:**

*   **Poor:**  Run-Time error ‘-2147469 (800405)’: Method ‘Private Profile String’ of object ‘System’ failed.
    **Better:** Virtual memory space consumed. Close some programs and retry.
*   **Poor:** Network connection refused.
    **Better:** Password was not recognized. Please retype.
*   **Poor:** Invalid date.
    **Better:** Arrival date must come after departure date.

### Appropriate Physical Format: Enhancing Readability and Comprehension

The sources recommend using mixed uppercase and lowercase letters for error messages to enhance readability. Uppercase-only messages should be reserved for brief, critical warnings.  Avoid using lengthy code numbers at the beginning of messages, as these can be confusing and intimidating for users.

### Placement and Presentation: Balancing Visibility and Clarity

The optimal placement of error messages is a matter of debate. Some argue for placing messages near the source of the error, while others suggest a consistent location at the bottom of the display. Dialog boxes can also be used to present error messages without cluttering the main display. However, it is important to avoid intrusive dialog boxes that halt all activity and require the user to move them before proceeding.

### Sound Alerts: Using Sound Judiciously

Sound alerts can be used to signal errors, but should be used sparingly. While they can be helpful in some situations, they can also be embarrassing or annoying for users. Offering users control over sound alerts aligns with the principle of user-centered design.

### Consistency and User Control: Ensuring a Predictable and Empowering Experience

Error messages should be consistent in terms of terminology, grammar, and visual format.  This consistency helps users understand the meaning of messages and reduces confusion. Providing users with control over error message presentation, such as the ability to customize the level of detail or turn off sound alerts, can further enhance their experience.

### Additional Considerations:

*   **Error Prevention:**  The sources emphasize the importance of designing systems that prevent errors from occurring in the first place. For instance, well-designed forms with clear instructions and input validation can minimize user errors. 
*   **User Testing:** Thoroughly testing error messages with representative users is crucial to ensure their clarity, helpfulness, and effectiveness. 

### Conclusion: Error Messages as Opportunities for Guidance and Support

Error messages, rather than simply pointing out mistakes, should be seen as opportunities to guide and support users. By following the guidelines outlined in the sources, designers can create error messages that enhance usability, reduce frustration, and foster a more positive user experience.
