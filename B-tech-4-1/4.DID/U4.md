Keyboards and keypads are the **most common ways to input text**, and they are essential components of digital interaction design. Their familiarity and **tactile feedback** make them very efficient for data input. Though heavily criticised over the years, the keyboard is a very successful device, and billions of people use it. 

### Keyboard and Keypad Usage 

* **Keyboards** are generally used for tasks like:
    * Document composition 
    * Email communication
    * Issuing commands
* **Keypads** are generally used for smaller devices like: 
    * Mobile phones 
    * Calculators 

### Keyboard and Keypad Design

The design of keyboards and keypads involves a lot of careful consideration and testing to optimise their form and function. Some important design considerations include: 

* **Layout and Physical Design:** 
    * The layout of keys is **crucial for user experience**. 
        * **QWERTY** is the most common layout, but layouts should be adapted for different languages and use cases.
        * There is still controversy about the design of **number pads**, with telephones and calculators using different layouts. 
    * The **size, spacing, and positioning** of keys must be carefully considered to ensure a comfortable and seamless user experience. 
        * These factors impact the user's ability to input data efficiently. 
    * Designers must consider **ergonomic design** to minimise user discomfort, especially during prolonged use. 
        * Alternative geometries like **split and tilted keyboards** have been tried, but empirical evidence of their benefits is limited.
* **Accessible Text Entry:** 
    * Designers must consider **accessibility** for users with different needs. 
        * This includes people with motor impairments and visually impaired users.
    * Some accessible text entry methods include:
        * **Adaptive keyboards** with lowered keys
        * **On-screen keyboards** accessed with alternative input devices like:
            * Head pointers
            * Oversized trackballs
        * **Dictionary-based auto-completion** and automatic error correction
        * **Non-visual input methods** like: 
            * **PerkInput** 
            * **BrailleTouch**
        * **Dasher**: Predicts characters and words and can be used with brain-computer interfaces. 
        * **orbiTouch's Keyless Keyboard**: Replaces keys with two inverted bowls and requires only small hand movements.
        * **Pointing devices** like mice, touchpads and eye-trackers 
        * **Wearable devices** like wristbands and rings 
        * **Speech input**
* **Mobile Text Entry:** 
    * Mobile devices present new challenges for text entry due to their: 
        * Limited screen space
        * Touch-based input 
    * Designers have developed various techniques to address these constraints. 
    * Some text entry methods used for mobile devices include:
        * **Multi-tap**: Requires multiple taps on a key to cycle through letters, with pauses necessary between consecutive letters.
        * **Predictive techniques** such as:
            * **T9®** 
            * **LetterWise**:  Uses probabilities of prefixes and allows the entry of non-dictionary words.
        * **Physical QWERTY keyboards**: Still preferred by some mobile users, especially those who enter a lot of text. 
        * **Soft keyboards**: Virtual keyboards displayed on the touchscreen. 
            * The benefit of soft keyboards is that they can be dynamically relabelled and resized to fit different character sets, layouts, and device orientations. 
            * Because they lack tactile feedback, soft keyboards are difficult to use for eyes-free operation and generally have lower performance. 
        * **Projection keyboards**: Project an image of a keyboard onto a surface. 
        * **Word completion suggestions**
        * **Language models** that predict words based on the current sentence 
        * **Swype** and **ShapeWriter**: Allow users to trace letters with a single gesture, using language models to resolve conflicts. 
        * **The Shift technique**: Helps mitigate the "fat finger" problem by displacing the screen content based on the user's touch. 
        * **Handwriting recognition**: Particularly promising for languages like Japanese and Chinese, but may be difficult for users with motor control issues. 
            * **Graffiti®** 
            * **EdgeWrite**: Uses a physical border and a modified character set to improve accuracy. 
        * **ZoomBoard**: Uses iterative zooming to make small keys usable on small displays. 
        * **Shorthand gesturing** 
* **Key Design:**
    * Keys are typically designed with:
        * **Concave surfaces** for good fingertip contact
        * A **matte finish** to reduce glare and finger slips
    * They require a specific force and displacement to activate, enabling rapid typing with few errors and providing feedback. 
        * **Tactile and audible feedback** are important in touch typing. 
    * **Larger keys** are used for frequently-used keys such as the: 
        * Space bar
        * Enter key 
        * Shift key
        * Ctrl key
    * Some keys, such as:
        * Caps Lock
        * Num Lock
    * ...should clearly indicate their state (for example, through an embedded light). 
    * **Large-print keyboards** are available for visually impaired users. 
* **Cursor Movement Keys:** 
    * The placement of cursor-movement keys is important for efficient and error-free use. 
    * Common cursor key arrangements include:
        * The **inverted-T** arrangement:  Allows for reduced hand and finger movement.
        * The **cross arrangement**: A good choice for new users. 
    * On some large keyboards, the numerical keypad keys are reused for diagonal movements, toggled by the Num Lock key. 
    * Some applications (such as games) reassign letter keys (often **WASD**) as cursor-movement keys to minimise finger motion.
* **Key Mapping and Shortcuts**: 
    * **Intuitive shortcuts** and customisation options improve user experience and efficiency.
    * Well-designed shortcuts can speed up common tasks, improving usability.

### The QWERTY Keyboard Layout

The QWERTY keyboard layout, designed by **Christopher Latham Sholes** in the 1870s, remains the dominant keyboard layout today.

* **Sholes's design** was successful because of its:
    * Good mechanical design
    * Clever placement of letters that slowed users down enough to prevent key jamming 
    * In this layout, frequently used letter pairs are far apart, increasing finger travel distances. 
* Despite its drawbacks, the success of **QWERTY** led to widespread standardisation. 
* The development of electronic keyboards eliminated the mechanical issues of typewriters, leading to the proposal of alternative layouts like **Dvorak**.
    * While these alternative layouts could improve typing speed and reduce errors, they failed to gain traction due to the effort required to learn a new, non-standard interface. 

The sources also discuss the **ABCDE keyboard layout**, which has letters in alphabetical order, and its limited effectiveness. They also cover **chorded keyboards** such as **stenotypes**, which allow for faster text entry but require extensive training.

### Concluding Thoughts

The evolution of keyboard and keypad technology has been driven by a focus on improving usability and efficiency. Designers continue to explore new layouts, designs, and input methods, especially in the context of mobile devices and accessibility.

    * **Hybrid Pointing Techniques**: These combine multiple pointing techniques, particularly relevant for large displays where traditional methods are impractical. 

### Fitts's Law

* Fitts's Law is a scientific model that predicts the time it takes to move a hand to a target, based on the distance to the target (D) and the target size (W). 
* This law helps designers determine optimal sizes and locations for buttons and other interactive elements. 
* The formula for movement time (MT) is: 

> MT = a + b log2(D/W + 1)

* Where:
    * 'a' represents the start/stop time for a specific device
    * 'b' measures the device's inherent speed
* These constants are determined experimentally for each device. 
* Fitts's Law has been extended to account for fine-tuning movements in high-precision pointing and other variations.

# An Introduction to Advancing the User Experience

This section (12.1 Introduction) from the source titled *U4.2.pdf* introduces the broader chapter's focus on advancing the user experience. The sources emphasise that interface design is becoming increasingly important in a competitive technological landscape where design matters. Just like modern car designers balance functionality and fashion, so too must interface designers. 

This chapter aims to address seven key design considerations that impact user experience. While each of these areas serves a functional purpose, they also offer opportunities for designers to showcase their style and cater to a diverse range of customers. The seven areas are:

* **Display Design**:  The layout of information is crucial. The goal is to transition from cluttered displays that overwhelm users to well-organised, information-rich layouts that enhance user satisfaction and reduce search time. This section will address issues related to universal usability, user-generated content, and the increasing complexity of web design and development. 
* **View (Window) Management**: This section focuses on coordinating multiple windows, minimising window-housekeeping actions, and reducing clutter. Understanding user tasks is crucial for developing effective multiple-window strategies. This section also explores techniques like synchronized scrolling, hierarchical browsing, and managing the opening/closing of dependent windows.
* **Animation**: This section highlights the judicious use of animation to improve the user experience. Animation can be used to keep users oriented during transitions, indicate affordances, provide entertainment, and signal background activity. It is also used in storytelling, alerting users, and providing virtual tours.  
* **Webpage Design**: The source acknowledges the considerable progress in webpage design in recent years, attributed to the emergence of new standards and tools. This section focuses on the visual layout of webpages and how it impacts human performance. It also addresses common web design mistakes, the increasing use of graphics, and the need to accommodate tablets, smartphones, and other touchscreen devices. 
* **Colour**: This section examines the potential benefits and challenges of using colour in interface design. Colour can enhance aesthetics, facilitate subtle discriminations, and evoke emotional responses, but its misuse can lead to distraction, confusion, and accessibility issues. Guidelines for the effective use of colour are provided, emphasizing the importance of user testing and catering to the needs of colour-deficient users. 
* **Nonanthropomorphic Design**: This section advocates for interfaces that avoid mimicking human qualities. It argues against attributing intelligence, autonomy, or free will to computers, suggesting that such characterisations can be deceptive and misleading for users. The focus is on promoting clear, predictable, and user-controlled interfaces that highlight the functional capabilities of computers.  
* **Error Messages**: This section focuses on crafting error messages that guide users effectively.  It stresses the importance of specificity, constructive guidance, a positive tone, user-centered phrasing, and an appropriate physical format for error messages. This section also suggests strategies for avoiding design disasters, such as maintaining consistency across applications, using separate files for error messages to facilitate translation, and prioritising user testing to identify areas for improvement. 

The sources suggest that acknowledging designers by including their names and photos on a title or credits page, as is common in games and educational software, could encourage higher quality work. 

While the sources do not explicitly mention it, you may consider the following point to enhance your understanding:

* **Accessibility**: While touched upon in several sections, a broader discussion of accessibility considerations in user interface design is relevant here. This includes catering to users with disabilities, ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies, and promoting inclusivity in digital environments. You may want to verify this information independently.

*   **Information Organisation:**  Clear and logical layouts are paramount. Well-structured displays that group related information and create visual hierarchies reduce cognitive load and enhance user satisfaction. Designers should carefully consider element placement to guide user attention effectively.
*   **Consistency and Familiarity:** Users should encounter familiar patterns and layouts throughout the interface. This consistency promotes ease of use and predictability, contributing to a positive user experience. For instance, maintaining consistent placement of navigation menus, buttons, and content elements across different screens or pages can foster a sense of familiarity.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**  Using typography, colour, size, and contrast to differentiate critical information from secondary details helps users quickly identify key actions or content. Visual hierarchy guides user attention and improves usability.
*   **Responsive Design:**  The proliferation of diverse devices and screen sizes necessitates responsive design. Interfaces must seamlessly adapt to various screen dimensions to ensure a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   **Typography and Readability:** The choice of fonts, font sizes, line spacing, and text contrast significantly impacts readability. Designers must select legible typefaces, ensure appropriate text sizing, and pay attention to line length and paragraph spacing for a comfortable reading experience.
*   **Visual Aesthetics:**  Attractive visuals and a well-chosen colour scheme contribute to the overall user experience. A visually appealing interface not only facilitates tasks but also creates a pleasing environment for users. 
*   **Accessibility:**  Inclusive design is fundamental. All users, including those with disabilities, should be able to interact with the display. Incorporating accessibility features such as alternative text for images and keyboard navigation ensures inclusivity and compliance with accessibility standards.
*   **Performance:** Interfaces should load quickly and respond promptly to user interactions. Slow or unresponsive displays can lead to user frustration.
*   **Testing and User Feedback:**  Usability testing with real users and gathering user feedback are essential for identifying areas for improvement and refining the design to better align with user needs.

### Additional Insights from the Sources

The sources provide further insights into display design:

*   **Dense vs. Sparse Displays:** Research suggests that expert users often prefer denser displays because of their familiarity with the format and the reduced need for actions. However, for most users, well-organised displays with clear labels are more effective.
*   **Cluttered Displays:** Cluttered displays can overwhelm even knowledgeable users, highlighting the importance of thoughtful information layout and organisation.
*   **Mobile Screen Design:** The limited screen real estate on mobile devices requires special consideration. Designers must balance the convenience of touchscreens and portability with challenges such as smaller screen size, connectivity issues, and variations in app design.

### Emerging Trends in Display Technology (Not From Sources)

While the sources focus on fundamental display design principles, it's worth noting some emerging trends in display technology that are shaping the future of user interfaces. However, keep in mind that this information is not from the sources you provided, and you may want to verify it independently:

*   **Flexible and Foldable Displays:** These displays allow for innovative device designs and enhanced portability.

## Understanding View (Window) Management

The sources explain that view (window) management is an important aspect of user interface design, especially when dealing with graphical user interfaces and environments where users interact with multiple windows. It focuses on how these screens or windows are organised, displayed, and interacted with.  Let's break down the key considerations of view (window) management as discussed in the sources:

### Key Considerations for Effective View (Window) Management

*   **Organisation and Layout:** The sources highlight that a well-organised layout reduces clutter and improves user productivity by minimising the cognitive load associated with managing multiple windows. Designers need to think about how windows are arranged on the screen, how easily users can resize and reposition them, and the mechanisms for switching between different windows.
*   **Multiple-Window Coordination:**  The sources emphasise the need to understand why coordinating multiple windows is important.  Users often work with multiple applications or documents simultaneously. Designers should strive to facilitate smooth interactions between these windows, enabling users to easily copy and paste content, drag and drop files, or reference information across different windows.
*   **Window Management Controls:** Intuitive controls for managing windows are crucial. Users should be able to perform actions like minimizing, maximizing, resizing, and closing windows.  Additionally, they should have options for organising windows into stacks or tabs. These controls should simplify the process of handling multiple windows, contributing to a more efficient workflow. 
*   **Window Focus and Layering:** Window focus and layering determine which window is active and in the foreground. Users need clear visual cues to identify the focused window. Effective layering prevents windows from overlapping in an obstructive manner, ensuring that content is easily accessible and avoiding confusion.
*   **Task Switching:** The ability to switch between open applications or windows quickly is another key consideration. Designers should consider common methods for task switching, such as taskbars, alt-tab shortcuts, or gesture-based switching, and prioritize user convenience and speed.
*   **Minimization and Maximization:** These fundamental features should behave consistently and meet user expectations. Minimised windows should be easily restorable, and maximised windows should effectively utilise the available screen space. 
*   **Notification Management:**  The sources point out that integrating notification management within window management is increasingly important. Users often receive notifications from various applications, so managing these notifications effectively, including their visibility and the ability to dismiss or prioritize them, is a crucial part of view (window) management.

*   **Descriptiveness:** The message should provide sufficient information about the nature of the error, potential causes, and possible solutions.
*   **User-Centred Language:**  Use language that resonates with the user and avoids technical terminology. For example, instead of "Server error 404," use "We couldn't find the page you're looking for."
*   **Error Codes:** If error codes are necessary, ensure users can easily look up their meanings. Don't leave users in the dark with cryptic codes.
*   **Visual Distinction:** Make error messages visually prominent and distinct from regular content. Use colours, icons, or borders to highlight them.
*   **Placement:** Position error messages close to the action or data entry that triggered the error to ensure they are noticed.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent format and style for all error messages across the system. This promotes familiarity and reduces cognitive load.
*   **Actionable Advice:** Provide clear and actionable steps for users to resolve the error. For example, include links to navigate back or buttons to retry the action.
*   **Real-Time Validation:** When using forms, implement real-time validation feedback as users enter data to prevent the submission of incorrect information.

### Best Practices for Error Message Design

The sources recommend several best practices for creating user-friendly error messages:

*   **Preventative Design:**  Whenever possible, design interfaces to minimise errors. Use clear labelling, intuitive workflows, and validation rules to guide users.
*   **Prioritise Errors:**  Not all errors are equal. Focus on the most critical errors that have the most significant impact on the user experience.
*   **User Testing:** Conduct thorough user testing to ensure error messages are understandable and effective. Use user feedback to refine and improve them.
*   **Avoid Blame:** Error messages should never blame the user for the mistake. Focus on providing constructive solutions and support.
*   **Plain Language:** Avoid technical jargon and error codes that users might not understand without further explanation.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Test error messages under various scenarios, including network issues, data entry errors, and security breaches. Ensure they function as intended in all circumstances.

### Error Message Examples

The sources provide numerous examples of ineffective error messages and offer improved alternatives:

*   **Vague:** "SYNTAX ERROR" should be replaced with a more specific message like "Unmatched left parenthesis."
*   **Condemning:** "INVALID DATA" could be improved with guidance, such as "Days range from 1 to 31."
*   **Unhelpful:** "BAD FILE NAME" is more helpful when phrased as "The file C:\demo\data.txt was not found."
*   **Hostile:**  Avoid violent language like "FATAL ERROR, RUN ABORTED" or "CATASTROPHIC ERROR; LOGGED WITH OPERATOR." Replace these with informative and constructive messages.

### Non-Anthropomorphic Language in Error Messages

Following the principles of non-anthropomorphic design discussed in our previous conversation, avoid attributing human-like qualities to the computer when crafting error messages.

*   **Avoid "I":** Do not use the first-person pronoun "I" in error messages. For example, instead of "I cannot find that file," use "That file cannot be found." 
*   **Focus on the User:** Use the "you" form or simple statements of fact to guide the user. For example, "You can try again" or "Please check your spelling." 

By adhering to these guidelines, designers can create error messages that are informative, supportive, and contribute to a positive user experience.
