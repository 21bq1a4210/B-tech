         Type mismatch: cannot convert from int to byte

        Explanation:
         the subexpresion b*2 is performed using int which is automatic an int cant 
         assigned to a byte without the use of a cast.

        //solution:

         b = (byte) (b * 2);    // byte should be int ()
         /*we are explectuly converting b*2 which is in int to byte
         b=b*(byte)(2);  the same error will generate as above
