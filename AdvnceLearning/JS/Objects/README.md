# Mastering Object Methods in JavaScript

JavaScript provides a variety of methods and functionalities for working with objects. This guide will cover essential object methods that you need to know to effectively work with objects in JavaScript.

## 1. Object Creation and Manipulation

### Object.create()
The `Object.create()` method allows you to create a new object and link it to the prototype of an existing object. This is useful for creating object instances and extending them to more specific objects.

### Object.keys()
`Object.keys()` creates an array containing the keys of an object. It's useful for extracting the keys of an object for further processing.

### Object.values()
`Object.values()` creates an array containing the values of an object. This is handy for extracting the values of an object.

## 2. Object Modification and Composition

### Object.entries()
`Object.entries()` creates a nested array of key/value pairs of an object. This is useful for iterating over an object's properties.

### Object.assign()
`Object.assign()` copies values from one object to another, effectively merging objects.

### Object.freeze()
`Object.freeze()` prevents modifications to an object's properties and values, as well as adding or removing properties.

## 3. Object Property Management

### Object.seal()
`Object.seal()` prevents new properties from being added to an object but allows the modification of existing properties. It's similar to `Object.freeze()`.

### Object.getPrototypeOf()
`Object.getPrototypeOf()` retrieves the internal hidden [[Prototype]] of an object, accessible through the `__proto__` property.

### Object.setPrototypeOf()
`Object.setPrototypeOf()` sets the prototype of a specified object to another object or `null`.
