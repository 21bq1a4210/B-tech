Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step, explaining each concept and line:

#1.Importing Required Modules:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import time
```
In this code, we import the `yfinance` module, which provides a convenient way to fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance. We also import the 'time' module, which allows us to introduce time delays in our code.

#2.Defining the 'get_stock_price' Function:
```python
def get_stock_price(symbols):
    while True:
        for symbol in symbols:
            try:
                data = yf.download(tickers=symbol, period='1d', interval='1m')
                if data.empty:
                    print(f"No data available for {symbol}")
                else:
                    latest_price = data['Close'].iloc[-1]
                    print(f"The latest price of {symbol} is: {latest_price}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"An error occurred for {symbol}: {str(e)}")
        time.sleep(60)  # Fetch stock prices every minute
```
This function `get_stock_price` takes a list of stock symbols as input. It contains a while loop that runs indefinitely to continuously fetch the stock prices. Inside the loop, we iterate over each symbol and fetch the stock data using the `yf.download` function.

We use a try-except block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the fetching process. If the 'data' object is empty, it means no data is available for that symbol, and we print a corresponding message. Otherwise, we extract the latest closing price from the data and print it.

Lastly, we introduce a time delay of 60 seconds using `time.sleep(60)` to fetch the stock prices every minute.

#3.Defining the List of Symbols:
```python
symbols = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "AMZN", "META"]
```
Here, we define a list called `symbols` that contains the stock symbols we want to monitor. You can add or remove symbols according to your preference. In this example, we have included symbols for Apple Inc. (AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), and Meta Platforms Inc. (META).

#4.Invoking the get_stock_price Function:
```python
get_stock_price(symbols)
```
This line calls the `get_stock_price` function, passing the symbols list as an argument. This starts the process of continuously fetching and printing the stock prices for the specified symbols.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the `yfinance` library to fetch real-time stock prices for multiple symbols. It continuously monitors the prices and provides updates every minute. You can modify the `symbols` list and customize the code according to your needs, such as changing the time interval or adding more error handling.
