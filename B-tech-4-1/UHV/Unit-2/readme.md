# Understanding the Human Being as Co-existence of Self (‘I’) and Body

## The Human Being: Co-existence of Self ('I') and Body

The sources explain that a human being is more than just a physical body; it is the co-existence of the Self (‘I’), which is conscious, and the Body, which is material.  The Self ('I') is described as the "sentient constituent of the human being". This means that the Self is the part of us that is aware of our own existence and experiences feelings and thoughts. The Body, on the other hand, is the physical structure that we can see and touch.

While the Self and Body are distinct entities, they exist in a close relationship and constantly exchange information. The Body provides the Self with information about the external world through sensations.  The Self then processes this information, makes decisions, and instructs the Body to act accordingly.  For example, when we decide to eat, the Self instructs the Body to pick up food, chew, and swallow.

### Distinct Needs of Self and Body

The sources highlight that the Self ('I') and the Body have distinct needs that must be fulfilled separately. 

**The need of the Self ('I') is happiness (*sukha*)**.  This happiness is a qualitative need, meaning it cannot be quantified or measured, and it is continuous in time. The sources explain that happiness is not something that can be achieved by acquiring physical possessions or fulfilling bodily desires; it is a state of inner harmony that arises from right understanding and right feeling. 

**The need of the Body is physical facilities (*suvidha*).** This includes things like food, clothing, shelter, and other material comforts. Unlike the Self's need for happiness, the Body's need for physical facilities is quantitative, meaning we can measure how much we need, and temporary in time.  

The sources emphasize that confusing these two needs leads to problems. Trying to achieve continuous happiness (*sukha*) through the acquisition of physical facilities (*suvidha*) will only lead to temporary pleasure and ultimately result in unhappiness and harm to the Body.

### The Body as an Instrument of the Self

The sources describe the Body as an "instrument" of the Self. This means that the Body acts according to the decisions and instructions of the Self. The Self is the one who sees, understands, decides, and enjoys, while the Body is the tool through which these actions are carried out.

### Sanyama and Svãsthya

The sources introduce the concepts of *Sanyama* and *Svãsthya* to explain the harmonious relationship between the Self and the Body.

**Sanyama** is described as "the feeling of responsibility in the Self ('I') for nurturing, protection and right utilization of the Body". It arises from the understanding that the Body is an instrument of the Self and requires proper care to function effectively.

**Svãsthya** is translated as "health" and is defined as the state in which "the Body acts according to the needs of ‘I’" and "there is harmony among the parts of the Body".

The sources emphasize that *Sanyama* is the basis for *Svãsthya*. When the Self lives with Sanyama, taking responsibility for the Body's well-being, the Body is more likely to achieve and maintain a state of health.

### Importance of Understanding Co-existence

The sources stress the importance of understanding the co-existence of Self and Body for achieving happiness and harmony in life. This understanding leads to a clearer distinction between the needs of the Self and the Body, allowing us to pursue happiness through the right means. Recognizing the Body as an instrument of the Self helps us develop a sense of responsibility for its care and well-being, leading to better health and a more fulfilling life.

# Understanding the needs of Self (‘I’) and ‘Body’ - happiness and physical facility.

## Examining the Distinct Needs of Self ('I') and Body

The sources extensively discuss the differing needs of the Self (‘I’) and the Body. The Self seeks **happiness (*sukha*)** while the Body requires **physical facilities (*suvidha*)**.  These needs are fundamentally different and fulfilling one does not equate to fulfilling the other.

### Happiness: The Need of the Self

The Self's need for happiness is **qualitative and continuous**.  It cannot be measured or quantified and we seek it all the time.  Happiness, as described in the sources, is not something that can be gained through material possessions or external achievements.  Instead, **right understanding and right feeling** are the foundations for true happiness. This means comprehending the harmony in ourselves and the world around us, and fostering positive emotions and relationships.

Importantly, the sources point out that attempting to satisfy the Self's constant need for happiness with the temporary fulfillment of the Body's needs will not result in true happiness. Rather, this approach can cause harm to both the Self and the Body.

### Physical Facilities: The Need of the Body

The Body's need for physical facilities is **quantitative and temporary**. This means we can measure how much we need, and that our needs are cyclical rather than constant. For example, the Body requires food for nourishment, but only periodically.  Once satiated, the need subsides for a time.

The sources emphasize that the need for physical facilities is **limited**, despite often being perceived as limitless. We can assess and list what our Body requires for proper functioning. When we try to obtain physical facilities beyond our genuine requirements, it becomes counterproductive and can lead to discomfort and problems.

### Money: A Representation of Physical Facilities

Money itself is not a need, but rather a representation of physical facilities.  Our need for money should stem from our assessed need for physical facilities to ensure the Body's well-being.  The sources caution against the misconception that accumulating money will automatically bring happiness. Instead, they highlight that focusing on right understanding, fulfilling relationships, and obtaining only the required physical facilities is a surer path to happiness and prosperity.

### Examples of Confusing Self and Body Needs

The sources provide a few illustrative examples of the consequences of confusing the needs of the Self with the needs of the Body:

* **Being in a luxurious setting with someone you dislike**: In this scenario, even though the Body is comfortable with the physical facilities provided, the Self feels unhappy due to the negative relationship.
* **Having plentiful, delicious food, but being forced to eat beyond satiation**: This example demonstrates how exceeding the Body's temporary need for food, even if initially enjoyable, ultimately results in discomfort and unhappiness.
* **Purchasing clothes for respect**: The sources explain that respect is a need of the Self and cannot be fulfilled by clothing the Body.  Seeking respect through external appearances is a misdirected attempt to satisfy the Self's needs through physical means.

### Conclusion:  A Holistic Approach

The sources emphasize the importance of understanding that humans are more than just their bodies. They advocate for a holistic approach to well-being that acknowledges and addresses the distinct needs of both the Self and the Body.  By cultivating right understanding, fulfilling relationships, and ensuring responsible care of the Body, we create a foundation for sustainable happiness and a meaningful life.

# Understanding the Body as an instrument of ‘I’ (I being the doer, seer and enjoyer).

## The Body as an Instrument of the Self ('I'): The Seer, Doer, and Enjoyer

The sources present the concept of the Body as an instrument wielded by the Self ('I'). This analogy emphasizes the distinct roles of these two entities and their interconnectedness in the human experience.

### I am, The Body is:  Consciousness and Materiality

The sources highlight a fundamental difference between the Self ('I') and the Body:

* **The Self ('I'):** The conscious entity. It is the "seer" that is aware of its own existence, understands, and experiences feelings and thoughts.
* **The Body:** The material entity. It acts according to the decisions and instructions of the Self ('I').

This distinction underscores that the Self ('I') is the source of awareness, understanding, and decision-making, while the Body is the physical vehicle through which these are expressed in the world.

### The Self ('I'): The Director of Action

The sources emphasize that the Self ('I') is the "doer" that wants to live and experience life.  This desire to live is a fundamental characteristic of the Self ('I'), which the sources term *Jivana*. However, the Self ('I') cannot act directly in the material world.  Instead, it utilizes the Body as its instrument to carry out its desires and intentions.

For instance, when we decide to eat, the Self ('I') initiates the process by choosing what to eat and how much to eat.  The Body then performs the physical actions of picking up the food, chewing, and swallowing, all directed by the Self ('I').  The same principle applies to all actions; the Self ('I') is the decision-maker, the director, while the Body is the actor, carrying out the instructions.

### The Self ('I'): The Experiencer of Life

The sources also portray the Self ('I') as the "enjoyer". It is the entity that experiences the world through the Body and derives pleasure or displeasure from those experiences.  

The Body serves as a conduit for sensory information, relaying sensations to the Self ('I'). It is the Self ('I'), however, that processes these sensations and experiences the resulting feelings and emotions. For example, the Body might taste food, but it is the Self ('I') that experiences the pleasure of a delicious meal.  Similarly, the Body might feel pain, but it is the Self ('I') that suffers from it.

### Implications of the Instrument Analogy

Understanding the Body as an instrument of the Self ('I') has profound implications for how we approach life and well-being:

* **Responsibility for the Body:** If the Body is our instrument, we become responsible for its care and maintenance.  This leads to the concept of *Sanyama* - the feeling of responsibility for nurturing, protecting, and rightly utilizing the Body.
* **Focus on the Self's Needs:** Recognizing that true happiness stems from the Self ('I') and not from bodily sensations helps us prioritize our pursuit of fulfilling experiences. This encourages us to focus on cultivating right understanding, fostering positive relationships, and engaging in activities that align with our values and aspirations.
* **Right Utilization of the Body:**  Understanding the purpose of the Body as an instrument for the Self ('I') encourages us to utilize it for fulfilling the Self's needs and aspirations. This includes engaging in actions that promote harmony within ourselves and with the world around us, rather than solely pursuing sensory pleasure or material gain. 

### Conclusion:  A Harmonious Partnership

The sources emphasize that understanding the Body as an instrument of the Self ('I') is not about denying the importance of the Body. Rather, it is about appreciating the distinct roles of both entities and fostering a harmonious partnership between them.  By recognizing the Self ('I') as the director, experiencer, and caretaker, we can utilize the Body effectively to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

# Understanding the characteristics and activities of ‘I’ and harmony in ‘I’

## Characteristics and Activities of 'I' and Harmony in 'I'

The sources describe the Self ('I') as the conscious entity within the human being, distinct from the material body. They emphasize that understanding the characteristics and activities of ‘I’ is crucial for achieving harmony within oneself and, consequently, in life.

### Characteristics of ‘I’

* **Consciousness:** The sources define 'I' as a conscious entity, also referred to as *Chaitanya* or *Chetna*. This means that 'I' is aware of its own existence and has the capacity for knowing, assuming, recognizing, and fulfilling. This consciousness is what distinguishes the Self ('I') from the Body, which is purely material.
* **Seeks Continuous Happiness:** The fundamental need of ‘I’ is continuous happiness (*sukha*). This happiness is not derived from external sources or possessions but rather from a state of inner harmony. The sources emphasize that this inherent desire for happiness propels individuals to seek ways to achieve and maintain it.
* **Inherently Seeks Harmony:**  'I' possesses a natural acceptance or inclination towards harmony at all levels of existence. This innate desire for harmony drives us to seek understanding and alignment with the inherent order in ourselves, our relationships, society, and nature/existence.
* **Capacity for Realization and Understanding:** The sources highlight that ‘I’ possesses the potential for **realization (*anubhava*)** and **understanding (*bodha*)**.  Realization refers to the ability to perceive reality as it is, while understanding is the capacity to comprehend the interconnectedness and harmony within existence. These faculties, though often dormant, can be activated through the process of self-exploration.
* **Similar in Essence:** The sources posit that, at the level of 'I', all human beings are similar. This similarity lies in our shared desire for happiness, our common program to achieve it by understanding and living in harmony, and our equal potential for knowing, assuming, recognizing, and fulfilling. The sources distinguish this fundamental similarity from the differences that arise at the level of understanding, which is influenced by individual experiences and knowledge.

### Activities of ‘I’

The sources describe several key activities that occur within the Self ('I'):

* **Desiring (Ichchha):** The activity of 'I' that manifests as the creation of images in the mind. These images represent our wants and aspirations, and the sources refer to this activity as **imaging (*chitrana*)**.
* **Thinking (Vichara):**  This activity involves analyzing and comparing various possibilities to fulfill desires. It is the process of expanding upon the images created by desire and breaking them down into smaller parts. The sources use the term **analyzing (*vishlesana*)** to describe this activity.
* **Expecting (Asha):** This activity involves making selections based on our preferences and anticipated outcomes. It is the process of evaluating and choosing among the various options presented by our thoughts and desires. The sources describe this activity as **selecting/tasting (*chayana/asvadana*)**. Note: "Tasting" here refers to the general sense of assessing and discriminating between what is favorable or unfavorable, not just the literal sense of taste.
* **Knowing (Janana):** This refers to the capacity for right understanding, which arises from realization and leads to a clear comprehension of reality and the harmony inherent in existence. This knowledge forms the basis for aligning our desires, thoughts, and expectations with truth and harmony.
* **Assuming (Manana):** This activity involves making assumptions and forming beliefs about the world around us.  The sources state that, in the absence of right understanding, our assumptions can be misguided and lead to disharmony and unhappiness.

### Harmony in ‘I’

Harmony in 'I' is achieved when the activities of 'I' are aligned with its natural acceptance of harmony at all levels of existence.  This occurs when:

* **Realization and Understanding Guide Our Activities:** When we operate from the level of realization and understanding [level 1 & 2 in source 71], our desires, thoughts, and expectations become congruent with our innate understanding of harmony. This leads to a state of 'self-organization' or *svatantrata*, characterized by definiteness, clarity, and a lack of internal conflict.
* **Imagination is Aligned with Natural Acceptance:** The activities of desiring, thinking, and expecting, collectively referred to as **imagination**, should be guided by our natural acceptance of harmony. When imagination is aligned with right understanding, our desires, thoughts, and expectations flow in a harmonious and coherent manner, leading to a sense of inner peace and fulfillment.
* **We Acknowledge the Body as an Instrument:**  Recognizing the Body as an instrument of ‘I’ helps to differentiate between their respective needs and prioritize the pursuit of true happiness. By cultivating **Sanyama**, the feeling of responsibility for nurturing, protecting, and rightly utilizing the Body, we foster harmony between the Self and the Body.

###  Consequences of Disharmony in ‘I’

When the activities of ‘I’ are not guided by right understanding and natural acceptance, it leads to disharmony within us. This manifests as:

* **Conflicts and Contradictions:**  Our desires, thoughts, and expectations become confused and contradictory, pulling us in different directions.
* **Enslavement to Sensations and Preconditioning:**  When we are not rooted in our natural acceptance, our imagination becomes dominated by sensations from the Body or pre-conditioned beliefs and assumptions. This leads to a state of enslavement or *paratantra*, where our choices are dictated by external influences rather than our own understanding and values.
* **Unhappiness and Suffering:**  Disharmony in 'I' inevitably leads to unhappiness and a sense of unfulfillment. This arises from the constant state of inner conflict and the inability to satisfy our innate need for harmony and meaning in life. 

The sources emphasize that the key to overcoming disharmony and achieving lasting happiness lies in cultivating right understanding, aligning our imagination with our natural acceptance, and living in harmony with ourselves, others, and the world around us.

# Understanding the harmony of I with the Body: Sanyam and Health; correct appraisal of Physical needs, meaning of Prosperity in detail

## Harmony of 'I' with the Body: Sanyam, Health, Physical Needs, and Prosperity

The sources emphasize that the human being is a co-existence of the Self ('I'), which is conscious, and the Body, which is material. These two entities have distinct needs and activities, yet they interact and influence each other significantly. The sources propose that true well-being arises from understanding this co-existence and fostering harmony between the Self ('I') and the Body.

### Sanyam: The Foundation of Harmony

The concept of *Sanyama* is central to understanding the harmony between the Self ('I') and the Body. Sanyama is defined as **"the feeling of responsibility in the Self ('I') for nurturing, protection and right utilization of the Body"**. This responsibility arises naturally from the understanding that the Body is an instrument of the Self ('I'), essential for interacting with the world and fulfilling the Self's aspirations. 

Sanyama is not about controlling or suppressing the Body but rather about caring for it with awareness and understanding.  It involves making conscious choices that support the Body's health and well-being, recognizing that a healthy Body is essential for the Self ('I') to function effectively. 

### Svasthya: The Expression of Harmony

When the Self ('I') practices Sanyama, the Body responds with *Svasthya*, a state of health and well-being.  The sources describe Svasthya as having two key elements:

1. **"The Body acts according to the needs of 'I'"**: The Body functions optimally, responding effectively to the Self's ('I') intentions and desires.
2. **"There is harmony among the parts of the Body"**: All the Body's systems and organs work together in a coordinated and balanced manner.

The word "Svastha" itself literally means "being anchored to the Self," indicating the close connection between the Self's ('I') state and the Body's health. When the Self ('I') is in a state of harmony, characterized by right understanding and positive feelings, this harmony extends to the Body, promoting Svasthya. Conversely, disharmony in the Self ('I'), such as anger, stress, or despair, can negatively impact the Body, leading to imbalances and even disease.

### Correct Appraisal of Physical Needs: The Path to Prosperity

The sources state that **"prosperity is the feeling of having more than required physical facilities"**. However, achieving true prosperity requires a correct understanding of our physical needs, which are directly related to the principles of Sanyama and Svasthya. 

Understanding that the Body is an instrument of the Self ('I') allows us to assess our physical needs in terms of:

* **Nurturing:** Providing the Body with the necessary resources for its sustenance and well-being, such as food, air, water, and rest.
* **Protection:** Safeguarding the Body from harm and ensuring its continued functioning, which includes clothing, shelter, and safety measures.
* **Right Utilization:** Using the Body in a way that aligns with the Self's ('I') purpose and values, which includes engaging in meaningful work, fostering healthy relationships, and contributing to society.

The sources emphasize that physical facilities are meant to serve these three purposes and that the quantity required for each is limited.  They challenge the common misconception that our needs are unlimited, pointing out that nature provides abundantly for our essential needs when we focus on what is truly necessary for our well-being.

By understanding our physical needs in the context of Sanyama and Svasthya, we can make a **"correct appraisal"** of what is required for a healthy and fulfilling life.  This correct appraisal is the foundation for achieving true prosperity, which is not simply an abundance of possessions but rather a feeling of having more than enough to meet our genuine needs.  The sources suggest that this feeling of prosperity can arise even when our material possessions are limited, as long as we understand the true purpose of physical facilities and focus on fulfilling our essential needs. 

### Key Takeaways

* The harmony between the Self ('I') and the Body is fundamental to human well-being.
* Sanyama, the feeling of responsibility for the Body, is the foundation of this harmony.
* Svasthya, a state of health and well-being, is the expression of this harmony.
* True prosperity arises from a correct appraisal of physical needs, which are limited and primarily meant for nurturing, protecting, and rightly utilizing the Body. 
* Understanding the interconnectedness of Sanyama, Svasthya, and prosperity allows us to make choices that support our overall well-being and live in greater harmony with ourselves and the world around us.

# Programs to ensure Sanyam and Health.

## Programs to Ensure *Sanyam* and *Svasthya*

The sources propose that *Sanyam* (self-regulation) and *Svasthya* (health) are interconnected aspects of well-being, arising from a harmonious relationship between the Self ('I') and the Body.  *Sanyam*, defined as the feeling of responsibility for the Body, leads to *Svasthya*, a state of health where the Body functions optimally and its parts are in harmony. 

To cultivate *Sanyam* and ensure *Svasthya*, the sources recommend a holistic approach that addresses the Body's needs for nurturing, protection, and right utilization.  These programs involve understanding the Body's natural functioning and making conscious choices that support its well-being. 

### Programs for Nurturing the Body

* **Āhāra (Proper Food):**  Selecting food that provides the Body with the necessary nutrients and energy is crucial for nurturing. This involves understanding the elements of a complete and balanced diet and choosing foods that are fresh, wholesome, and appropriate for one's individual constitution.  The sources highlight the importance of chewing food thoroughly for optimal digestion.  
* **Proper Air and Water:** Ensuring access to clean and fresh air and water is essential for the Body's health. This includes being mindful of environmental pollution and taking steps to minimize exposure to toxins in the air and water we consume.
* **Ingestion:** Consciously consuming food and being attentive to the process of eating helps to ensure proper digestion and assimilation of nutrients.
* **Routine:**  Establishing a regular routine for sleeping, waking, eating, and physical activity supports the Body's natural rhythms and promotes overall well-being.  This includes getting adequate sleep, maintaining regular meal times, and incorporating physical activity into daily life.

### Programs for Protecting the Body

* **Sanrakshana (Protection):** Choosing clothing and shelter that provide adequate protection from the elements while allowing for proper interaction with the environment is essential. This involves considering factors such as temperature regulation, ventilation, and exposure to sunlight.
* **Vihara (Proper Upkeep):** Maintaining proper hygiene, ensuring adequate rest and relaxation, and creating a clean and comfortable living environment support the Body's overall health and vitality.

### Programs for Right Utilization of the Body

* **Shrama (Physical Labour):** Engaging in physical labour is beneficial for maintaining physical fitness and promotes a sense of purpose and accomplishment. This could involve activities such as gardening, housework, or participating in manual work that contributes to the well-being of the community.
* **Vyāyāma (Exercise):**  Regular physical exercise helps to strengthen the Body, improve flexibility, and enhance overall well-being.  Choosing activities that are enjoyable and suitable for one's physical condition is important for maintaining motivation and consistency. 
* **Āsana-Pranāyāma:** Practicing yoga asanas and pranayama, which involve specific postures and breathing techniques, helps to harmonize the Body and mind and promotes a deep sense of well-being. These practices can improve flexibility, strength, balance, and mental clarity, supporting the Body's overall functioning. 
* **Sadupayoga (Right Utilization):**  Using the Body for ethical and meaningful purposes is essential for right utilization.  This involves engaging in activities that are aligned with one's values and contribute to the well-being of oneself and others. It also includes avoiding actions that harm or exploit others or the environment.
* **Arranging for Instruments/Equipment:** Utilizing tools and equipment that enhance the Body's efficiency and reduce unnecessary strain or exertion can support right utilization. 

### Programs for Addressing Imbalances

* **Aushadhi-Chikitsa (Treatment):**  The sources acknowledge that, despite our best efforts, the Body may sometimes require treatment to address imbalances or illness. They emphasize that treatment should aim to facilitate the Body's natural healing processes rather than suppressing symptoms. This may involve using natural remedies, seeking medical attention, or adjusting one's lifestyle to support recovery.
* **Addressing Environmental Pollution:**  Recognizing that environmental pollution can negatively impact our health, it's important to support initiatives that promote clean air, water, and food. This includes advocating for sustainable practices, reducing our own environmental footprint, and supporting businesses and organizations committed to environmental responsibility.

### Importance of Right Understanding 

The sources emphasize that **right understanding** forms the basis for all programs aimed at ensuring *Sanyam* and *Svasthya*. Without a clear understanding of the Self ('I'), the Body, and their interconnectedness, our efforts to care for the Body may be misdirected or incomplete.  Right understanding includes:

* **Recognizing the Body as an Instrument of the Self ('I'):**  This understanding helps us differentiate between the needs of the Self ('I') and the Body and prioritize the pursuit of true happiness, which is a state of inner harmony rather than a result of external gratification. 
* **Understanding the Purpose of Physical Facilities:**  Realizing that physical facilities are meant to serve the needs of the Body, we can make a correct appraisal of what is necessary for a healthy and fulfilling life, leading to a sense of prosperity even with limited possessions.  

By cultivating right understanding and incorporating the programs for nurturing, protecting, and rightly utilizing the Body, we can establish a harmonious relationship between the Self ('I') and the Body, fostering both *Sanyam* and *Svasthya* and leading to a life of greater well-being and fulfillment.
