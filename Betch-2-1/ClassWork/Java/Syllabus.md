Java Programming:

Course Objectives:
1. To understand object-oriented programming concepts, and apply them in solving 
problems.
2. To make the students to learn the principles of inheritance and polymorphism; and to 
demonstrate how they relate to the design of abstract classes; to introduce the 
implementation of packages and interfaces.
3. To make the students to learn the concepts of exception handling. 
4. To make the students to learn the concepts of multithreading.
5. To make the students to develop GUI applications.
