# Introduction to Hive

Hive is a data warehousing tool developed by Facebook to manage large volumes of log data. It was developed in 2007 and became an Apache Hadoop sub-project in 2008. Hive is built on top of Hadoop and uses the following components:

* **HDFS** for storage
* **MapReduce** for execution
* An **RDBMS** to store metadata/schemas

Hive is **not** an RDBMS and is **not** designed to support:
* OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
* Real-time queries
* Row-level updates

Hive provides a SQL-like language called **HiveQL (HQL)** for querying data. HQL is easy to code and supports rich data types, SQL filters, group-by and order-by clauses, custom types, and custom functions. Hive compiles SQL queries into MapReduce jobs and runs them in the Hadoop cluster. It provides extensive data type functions and formats for data summarisation and analysis. 

### Hive Architecture

Hive interacts with HDFS through various user interfaces. The main components of Hive architecture are:

* **Hive Command-Line Interface (Hive CLI)**: The most commonly used interface to interact with Hive.
* **Hive Web Interface**: A simple GUI for interacting with Hive and executing queries.
* **Hive Server**: An optional server that allows Hive jobs to be submitted from a remote client.
* **JDBC/ODBC**: Allows jobs to be submitted from a JDBC Client. Java code can be written to connect to Hive and submit jobs.
* **Driver**: Receives Hive queries and performs compilation, optimisation, and execution.
* **Metastore**: Stores Hive table definitions and mappings to the data.
* **Hadoop**: Hive uses Hadoop's HDFS for storage and MapReduce for execution.

The **metastore** consists of:
* **Metastore service**: Offers an interface to Hive.
* **Database**: Stores data definitions, mappings to the data, and other metadata.

There are three types of metastores:
* **Embedded Metastore**: Default metastore for Hive, mainly used for unit tests. Only allows one process to connect at a time. Both the database and the metastore service run embedded in the main Hive Server process. Uses Apache Derby Database.
* **Local Metastore**: Allows multiple connections at a time. Metadata can be stored in any RDBMS, such as MySQL. The Hive metastore service runs in the main Hive Server process, but the metastore database runs in a separate process and can be on a separate host.
* **Remote Metastore**:  The Hive driver and metastore interface run on different JVMs, which can run on different machines. The database can be firewalled from Hive users, and database credentials are completely isolated from users of Hive.

### Hive Data Units

Hive data is organised into the following units:
* **Databases**: Namespaces for tables.
* **Tables**: Sets of records with similar schemas. Tables in Hive are stored as folders. 
* **Partitions**: Logical separations of data based on specific attributes. They split a larger dataset into smaller, more meaningful chunks, improving query performance. Partition tables are stored as subdirectories.
* **Buckets or clusters**: Similar to partitions, but uses a hash function to segregate data. Bucketed tables are stored as files.

### Hive Data Types

Hive data types are classified into four categories:
* **Column Types**: Used as data types for columns in Hive tables. 
    * **Integral Types**: `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INT`, `BIGINT`
    * **String Types**: `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`
    * **Date and Time Types**: `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`
    * **Decimal Type**: `DECIMAL(precision, scale)`
    * **Union Types**: `UNIONTYPE<data_type1, data_type2, ...>`
* **Literals**: Represent fixed values in HiveQL queries.
* **Null Values**: Represent missing or unknown values. 
* **Complex Types**: Allow storing collections of data within a single column.
    * **Arrays**: Similar to Java arrays. Syntax: `ARRAY<data_type>`
    * **Maps**: Similar to Java Maps. Syntax: `MAP<primitive_type, data_type>`
    * **Structs**:  Similar to C structs. Syntax: `STRUCT<col_name : data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...>`

### Hive File Format

Hive supports various file formats for storing data:
* **Text File**: The default format. Each record is a line in the file, with different control characters used as delimiters. Supports CSV, TSV, JSON, and XML.
* **Sequential File**: Stores binary key-value pairs. Includes compression support.
* **RCFile (Record Columnar File)**: Stores data in a column-oriented manner, making aggregation operations more efficient.

### Hive Query Language (HQL)

HiveQL (HQL) is Hive's query language, which is similar to SQL. It supports the following operations:
* Creating and managing tables and partitions
* Relational, arithmetic, and logical operators
* Functions
* Downloading table content to a local directory or query results to an HDFS directory. 

HQL includes two main types of statements:

* **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used to create, modify, and delete database objects like databases, tables, views, and indexes. 
    * Examples: `CREATE DATABASE`, `DROP TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE VIEW`
* **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**:  Used to manipulate data within tables. 
    * Examples: `LOAD DATA`, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

### User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

Hive allows users to define custom functions using Java. These UDFs can then be used in HQL queries to extend Hive's functionality. The process involves:

1. Writing the Java code for the UDF.
2. Converting the Java code into a JAR file.
3. Adding the JAR file to Hive using the `ADD JAR` command.
4. Creating a temporary function that maps to the UDF using the `CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION` command.

For example, the sources show how to create a UDF to convert a string to uppercase.

# Hive architecture

The sources provide a detailed overview of Hive's architecture. Hive is a data warehousing tool built on top of Hadoop that is used to process structured data. It was initially created by Facebook to manage their growing volumes of log data. Hive uses Hadoop's Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage and MapReduce for execution. 

Here's a breakdown of the key components of Hive architecture:

### User Interface

Hive provides various user interfaces to interact with HDFS. These interfaces allow users to submit queries, manage tables, and perform other tasks. The most commonly used interfaces are:

*   **Hive Command-Line Interface (Hive CLI)**: This is a text-based interface that allows users to enter HiveQL commands.
*   **Hive Web Interface**: This is a graphical interface that provides a more user-friendly way to interact with Hive.
*   **Hive HD Insight**: This interface is specifically designed for use with Windows Server.

### Hive Server

Hive Server is an optional component that allows remote clients to submit Hive jobs. This allows users to interact with Hive from applications written in various programming languages.

### Driver

The Driver component is responsible for receiving Hive queries from the user interface and processing them. It performs the following tasks:

*   **Compilation**: The Driver converts the HiveQL query into an executable plan.
*   **Optimisation**: The Driver optimises the execution plan to improve performance.
*   **Execution**: The Driver submits the optimised execution plan to the execution engine.

### Metastore

The Metastore is a central repository that stores metadata about Hive data. This metadata includes:

*   Database names and locations
*   Table schemas, including column names and data types
*   Partitioning and bucketing information

The Metastore can be implemented using various relational database management systems (RDBMS), such as Apache Derby and MySQL.

### Execution Engine

The execution engine processes the query plan generated by the Driver and executes it using Hadoop MapReduce. It interacts with HDFS or HBase to read and write data.

### HDFS or HBase

Hive uses HDFS or HBase for data storage. HDFS is a distributed file system that is designed to store large datasets across a cluster of machines. HBase is a NoSQL database that provides random access to data stored in HDFS.

### Types of Metastores

There are three types of Metastores:

*   **Embedded Metastore**: This is the default Metastore and is primarily used for unit testing. It is not recommended for production environments because it allows only one process to connect at a time.
*   **Local Metastore**: This Metastore allows multiple connections and can be used in production environments. The Metastore service runs in the same JVM as the Hive server process, but the database can run in a separate process or on a different host. 
*   **Remote Metastore**: In this configuration, the Hive driver and the Metastore service run in separate JVMs, which can be located on different machines. This provides greater flexibility and scalability. 

### Hive Data Units

Hive organizes data into a hierarchical structure consisting of databases, tables, partitions, and buckets.

*   **Databases**: Databases are the top-level containers for Hive data. They provide a namespace for tables. 
*   **Tables**: Tables are collections of records with similar schemas.
*   **Partitions**: Partitions are logical subdivisions of tables based on specific attribute values. This allows for efficient querying of data based on those attributes.
*   **Buckets**: Buckets are further subdivisions of partitions that use a hash function to group data. This can be used to improve the performance of certain types of queries.

### Hive Query Language (HQL)

Hive uses a SQL-like query language called HiveQL (HQL) to interact with data. It supports a wide range of SQL features, including:

*   Data definition language (DDL) statements for creating, altering, and dropping databases, tables, and other objects.
*   Data manipulation language (DML) statements for loading, inserting, querying, updating, and deleting data.
*   Relational operators, such as joins, unions, and subqueries.
*   Aggregation functions, such as count, sum, avg, min, and max.
*   Group by and having clauses for grouping and filtering data.

### User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

Hive allows users to define custom functions called UDFs to extend its functionality. These functions are written in Java and can be used in HQL queries. UDFs can perform tasks that are not possible with built-in Hive functions.

# Hive Data Types

## Hive Data Types

The sources provide a detailed explanation of Hive's data types. Hive offers a diverse range of data types to represent and store various kinds of data. These data types are grouped into four main categories: Column Types, Literals, Null Values, and Complex Types.

### Column Types

Column types are the fundamental building blocks for defining the structure of data within Hive tables. They determine the type of information that can be stored in each column. The sources describe several categories of column types:

* **Integral Types:** These types represent whole numbers and include:
    * **TINYINT:** A 1-byte signed integer.
    * **SMALLINT:** A 2-byte signed integer.
    * **INT:** A 4-byte signed integer. If the data range exceeds the capacity of INT, you should use BIGINT.
    * **BIGINT:** An 8-byte signed integer. Use this type when the data range is larger than INT. 

* **String Types:** These types represent textual data and include:
    * **STRING:** Available from Hive 0.12.0 onwards. Can be specified using single or double quotes.
    * **VARCHAR:**  Available from Hive 0.13.0 onwards. This type has a variable length ranging from 1 to 65355 characters.
    * **CHAR:** This type has a fixed length of 255 characters. Hive follows C-style escape characters for strings.

* **Date and Time Types:** These types represent date and time information:
    * **TIMESTAMP:** Stores traditional UNIX timestamps with optional nanosecond precision. It supports both the Java `java.sql.Timestamp` format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.fffffffff`) and the format `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.ffffffffff`.
    * **DATE:** Represents dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

* **Decimal Type:** 
    * **DECIMAL(precision, scale):**  Similar to the `BigDecimal` type in Java. This type provides immutable arbitrary-precision decimal values, allowing for precise calculations. `precision` defines the total number of digits, and `scale` defines the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. For example, `DECIMAL(10,0)` defines a decimal with a total of 10 digits and no digits after the decimal point.

* **Union Types:** Union types enable storing different data types within a single column:
    * **UNIONTYPE<data_type1, data_type2, ...>:** The syntax for defining a union type. This allows you to store values of different data types in a single column. For example, `UNIONTYPE<int, double, array<string>, struct<a:int,b:string>>` defines a union type that can hold integers, doubles, string arrays, or structs with an integer and a string field.

### Literals

Literals represent constant values within HiveQL queries. They are used to provide specific values for comparisons, calculations, and other operations.

### Null Values

Null values represent missing or unknown data in Hive.  

### Complex Types

Complex types are used to store collections of data within a single column. They offer ways to represent more complex data structures and relationships:

*   **Arrays:** Hive arrays are similar to arrays in Java and are declared using the syntax `ARRAY<data_type>`.
*   **Maps:** Hive maps are similar to maps in Java and allow storing key-value pairs. They are declared using the syntax `MAP<primitive_type, data_type>`.
*   **Structs:** Hive structs are similar to C structs and allow grouping different data types under a single column. They are declared using the syntax `STRUCT<col_name : data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...>`. 

By utilizing these data types, Hive provides flexibility and the ability to represent a variety of data structures, making it a versatile tool for data warehousing and analysis.

|              | **DOUBLE**                   | Double-precision floating-point number, using 8 bytes of storage.                                                                                                                | 8            | 10.5                                                |          |
|              | **STRING**                   | Represents textual data. Introduced in Hive 0.12.0. Can be enclosed in single or double quotes.                                                                                      | Variable     | 'Hive' or "Hive"                                      |     |
|              | **VARCHAR**                  | Introduced in Hive 0.13.0, VARCHAR is for storing variable-length strings, with a maximum length of 65,535 characters.                                                         | Variable     | VARCHAR(50) 'Hive'                                  |     |

**Notes:** 

* The size of variable data types, including STRING, VARCHAR, and complex types, depends on the specific data stored.
* Hive data types are crucial for organising and manipulating data within Hive tables.  Understanding these data types helps optimise storage and improve the efficiency of data processing operations. 

This table offers a more complete representation of Hive data types, including the source for each piece of information.

# Hive File Foramt

The sources discuss several Hive file formats, detailing how Hive encodes and structures data within files:

*   **Text File**: This is Hive's default file format. 
    *   Each line in the file represents a record. 
    *   Control characters like tabs, commas, or other user-defined characters act as delimiters to separate fields within a record. 
    *   Hive supports several common text-based data formats, including CSV (Comma Separated Values), TSV (Tab Separated Values), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and XML (Extensible Markup Language).

*   **Sequential File**:  
    *   Sequential files are flat files designed to store binary key-value pairs. 
    *   These files often incorporate compression, which can significantly reduce CPU usage and input/output (I/O) requirements.

*   **RCFile (Record Columnar File)**:  
    *   RCFile is a hybrid file format that combines aspects of both row-oriented and column-oriented storage. 
    *   It partitions data both horizontally (into row groups) and vertically (by columns). 
    *   This structure makes RCFile particularly efficient for aggregation operations because it avoids the need to scan entire rows, which can be expensive in traditional row-oriented database management systems. 

The choice of file format in Hive impacts data storage efficiency and query performance. For example, if a table frequently undergoes aggregation operations, storing it as an RCFile can be more efficient than using a text file.

# Hive Query Language (HQL) Explained

Hive Query Language (HQL) is Hive's query language. It is similar to SQL (Structured Query Language), making it relatively easy for those familiar with SQL to write queries in Hive. HQL is designed to work with structured data stored in Hadoop. 

Here are some of the key capabilities of HQL:

*   **Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements:** HQL provides commands for creating, modifying, and deleting databases and tables. 
    *   **Database Management:** You can create databases using the `CREATE DATABASE` statement, drop them with `DROP DATABASE`, and alter database properties using `ALTER DATABASE`.
    *   **Table Management:** HQL allows you to define the structure of tables using `CREATE TABLE`, remove tables with `DROP TABLE`, modify table structures with `ALTER TABLE`, and clear the contents of a table using `TRUNCATE TABLE`.

*   **Data Manipulation Language (DML) Statements:**  These statements are used to work with the data within Hive tables. 
    *   **Loading Data:** You can load data from files into Hive tables using the `LOAD DATA` statement. The sources demonstrate using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH` to load data from the local file system, but you can also load data directly from HDFS. 
    *   **Inserting Data:** HQL allows you to insert data into Hive tables using the `INSERT` statement.
    *   **Querying Data:**  The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from Hive tables. You can use various clauses like `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` to filter, group, sort, and limit the data retrieved.
    *   **Updating and Deleting Data:** The sources mention that Hive 0.14 and later versions support `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements for modifying and deleting data within tables.

*   **Support for Relational, Arithmetic, and Logical Operators:** HQL supports a wide range of operators, including:
    *   **Relational Operators:** `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`
    *   **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` 
    *   **Logical Operators:** `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`

*   **Functions:** HQL provides built-in functions for data manipulation and aggregation, including functions like `avg`, `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, and many others.

*   **Sub-Queries:** Hive supports sub-queries in the `FROM` clause and, in versions 0.13 and later, in the `WHERE` clause. Sub-queries let you use the results of one query as input for another. 

*   **Joins:**  Like SQL, HQL supports various types of joins, enabling you to combine data from multiple tables based on common columns. The sources provide an example of using a `JOIN` to combine student and department data based on a shared 'rollno' column. 

*   **Partitioning and Bucketing:** HQL provides statements for managing partitioned and bucketed tables, which are essential for optimising query performance on large datasets. 

*   **User-Defined Functions (UDFs):** Hive allows you to create and use custom functions written in Java.  The sources offer an example of creating a UDF called `MyLowerCase` to convert a string to lowercase. UDFs add extensibility to HQL, letting you tailor functions to specific needs.

HQL's flexibility and similarity to SQL make it a powerful tool for querying, analysing, and managing data in Hadoop. It combines the familiar structure of SQL with the scalability of Hadoop, providing a robust platform for working with large datasets.

# Hive Partitions and bucketing

## Hive Partitioning and Bucketing: Enhancing Query Performance

Partitioning and bucketing are two crucial techniques in Hive that significantly enhance query performance, especially when dealing with massive datasets. Both methods aim to divide data into smaller, more manageable chunks, making data access and processing more efficient. However, they differ in their approach and application.

### Hive Partitions: Dividing Data by Value

*   **Partitions** are logical divisions of data based on specific values within a table's columns. Think of partitions as separate folders within a directory, each holding data associated with a particular value of the partitioned column.
*   When a table is partitioned, Hive creates subdirectories within the table's directory in HDFS, reflecting the partitioning structure. For example, if you partition a customer table by "country," Hive will create subdirectories for each unique country value, such as `/customers/country=Australia`, `/customers/country=USA`, and so on.
*   **Benefits of Partitioning:**
    *   **Improved Query Performance:** Queries that filter data based on the partitioned column become much faster. Hive can directly access the relevant partition without scanning the entire table, resulting in significant I/O reduction.
    *   **Organised Data Storage:** Partitioning organises data logically, making it easier to manage and maintain large datasets.

**Types of Partitioning:**

*   **Static Partitioning:** Requires the user to explicitly specify the partition value during data loading. This approach offers more control but can be cumbersome for tables with many partitions.
*   **Dynamic Partitioning:**  Hive automatically creates partitions based on the distinct values in the specified column during data loading. This approach is more efficient but requires careful configuration to avoid creating too many partitions.

### Hive Bucketing: Grouping Data by Hash

*   **Bucketing** is a technique for further dividing data within partitions. Unlike partitions, which create separate directories, buckets group data into files based on a hash function applied to a specific column.
*   **Benefits of Bucketing:**
    *   **Enhanced Sampling:** Bucketing makes it easy to take a random sample of data. You can sample from a specific bucket, representing a subset of the data, without needing to process the entire dataset.
    *   **Optimised Joins:** When tables are bucketed on the same column, Hive can perform joins more efficiently by processing buckets in parallel.

### Choosing Between Partitioning and Bucketing

*   **Cardinality:** The number of distinct values in a column, referred to as cardinality, is a key factor in deciding between partitioning and bucketing. 
    *   **High Cardinality:** For columns with high cardinality, such as customer ID, bucketing is often preferable as partitioning would lead to numerous partitions, potentially impacting performance.
    *   **Low Cardinality:** Partitioning works well for columns with low cardinality, such as "country" or "state."

*   **Query Patterns:** The types of queries frequently executed on the table also influence the choice.
    *   **Frequent Filtering:** If queries frequently filter data based on specific column values, partitioning on those columns can drastically improve query speed.
    *   **Frequent Joins:** Bucketing on the join column can optimise join operations, especially if the join involves large datasets.

### Key Differences:

| Feature           | Partitions                                                                                    | Buckets                                                                                         |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Division     | Divides data into subdirectories based on distinct values in a column.                         | Groups data into files within partitions based on a hash function applied to a column.           |
| Data Organisation | Creates a hierarchical directory structure reflecting the partitioning scheme.                   | Organizes data within partitions into a fixed number of files (buckets).                            |
| Application       | Ideal for filtering data based on specific values, especially for columns with low cardinality. | Beneficial for sampling data, optimizing joins, and handling columns with high cardinality.       |

**In practice, partitioning and bucketing are often used in conjunction.** A table can be partitioned by one column and then further bucketed based on another column within each partition. This combined approach maximises query performance by organising and dividing data effectively. 

Remember, the optimal strategy depends on the specific characteristics of your data and the types of queries you execute.

# RCFile Implementatiom


**RCFile (Record Columnar File)** is a data storage format specifically designed for Hive that leverages a hybrid approach, combining elements of row-oriented and column-oriented storage to achieve efficiency in various operations. 

**Understanding RCFile's Hybrid Structure**

Traditional database management systems often employ row-oriented storage, where data is stored sequentially row by row. In contrast, column-oriented databases store data column by column.  RCFile borrows from both approaches, resulting in a structure optimised for Hive's query processing:

1.  **Horizontal Partitioning (Row Groups):**  RCFile horizontally partitions data into "row groups." Each row group contains a user-defined number of rows. This horizontal division mirrors the traditional row-oriented approach, preserving some locality of data within rows.

2.  **Vertical Partitioning (Column-Store):** Within each row group, RCFile partitions data vertically, storing data for each column separately. This column-oriented storage proves advantageous for specific operations like aggregation (e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`). When you need to calculate the sum of values in a specific column, RCFile can directly access and process only the relevant column data within each row group without scanning entire rows.

**Visualising RCFile**

Consider a table with four columns, C1, C2, C3, and C4, as shown in Table 9.1 in the sources. The sources illustrate how RCFile would store this data:

1.  **Row Groups:** The table is divided into two row groups (Table 9.2). You can specify the number of rows in each group based on your data and system characteristics.
2.  **Column-Store Serialisation:** Within each row group, data is serialised column by column. Table 9.3 shows how the data from Table 9.1 is rearranged.

**Benefits of RCFile**

*   **Efficient Aggregation:** RCFile's columnar storage enables rapid data aggregation. Since data for a particular column is stored contiguously, Hive can quickly compute aggregates without scanning unnecessary data.
*   **Reduced I/O:** The hybrid approach strikes a balance between row and column storage, potentially reducing I/O overhead compared to strictly row-oriented formats, especially for queries involving aggregations.
*   **Compression Support:** RCFile supports compression within row groups and columns, further optimising storage space and I/O efficiency.

**Working with RCFile**

To create a table using the RCFile format, you can use the `STORED AS RCFILE` clause in your `CREATE TABLE` statement. The sources demonstrate this with the following example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE STUDENT_RC( rollno int, name string,gpa float ) STORED AS RCFILE;
```

This statement creates a table named `STUDENT_RC` where data will be stored using the RCFile format. You can then insert data into this table and execute queries as you would with any other Hive table.

# Working with XML Files in Hive

Hive provides mechanisms to work with unstructured data formats like XML. While Hive primarily excels at handling structured data, you can leverage features like **SerDe** (Serializer/Deserializer) to process and extract information from XML files.

### SerDe: Bridging Unstructured and Structured Data

*   A SerDe is a critical component in Hive that handles the conversion between Hive's internal data representation and the external data format stored in files.
*   **For XML files, you can use a SerDe that understands the XML structure and can parse it to extract data into Hive's tabular format.**

### Example of XML Processing in Hive

The sources provide an example of how to manipulate XML data using Hive. The provided XML data looks like this:

```xml
<employee>
    <empid>1001</empid>
    <name>John</name>
    <designation>Team Lead</designation>
</employee>
<employee>
    <empid>1002</empid>
    <name>Smith</name>
    <designation>Analyst</designation>
</employee>
```

Here's how the example in the sources processes this XML data:

1.  **Create a Table:** A table is created to store the raw XML data as strings.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE XMLSAMPLE(xmldata string);
    ```

2.  **Load the XML Data:** The XML file (`/root/hivedemos/input.xml`) is loaded into the `XMLSAMPLE` table.

    ```sql
    LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/root/hivedemos/input.xml' INTO TABLE XMLSAMPLE;
    ```

3.  **Extract Data Using XPath:** A new table, `xpath_table`, is created using XPath expressions to extract specific elements from the XML data.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE xpath_table AS
    SELECT 
        xpath_int(xmldata,'employee/empid'),
        xpath_string(xmldata,'employee/name'),
        xpath_string(xmldata,'employee/designation')
    FROM xmlsample;
    ```

    *   `xpath_int()`: Extracts an integer value based on the XPath expression.
    *   `xpath_string()`: Extracts a string value based on the XPath expression.

4.  **Query the Extracted Data:** You can now query the `xpath_table` to retrieve the structured data extracted from the XML.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM xpath_table;
    ```

    This query would return:

    ```
    1001   John    Team Lead
    1002   Smith   Analyst
    ```

### Key Points and Considerations

*   **Built-in Functions:** Hive provides built-in functions like `xpath_int()`, `xpath_string()`, and others to facilitate XML parsing.
*   **Custom SerDe:** For more complex XML structures or specific processing requirements, you might need to create a custom SerDe using Java.
*   **Limitations:** While Hive can handle XML data, it's essential to understand its limitations. Hive is not a full-fledged XML database, and its XML processing capabilities might not be as comprehensive as dedicated XML processing tools.

**Note:** The specific SerDe used in the example is not mentioned in the sources. To replicate this example, you might need to find a suitable XML SerDe or implement a custom one. You can find information on available SerDes and their usage in the Hive documentation or from other online resources.

## Understanding User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in Hive

Hive's flexibility extends to allowing users to define custom functions, known as **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**, to enhance its capabilities beyond the built-in functions. This feature is particularly useful when you need to perform specialised data transformations or calculations not readily available in Hive's standard function library.

### Creating and Using UDFs

The sources outline the process of creating and using a UDF:

1.  **Write the Java Code:** You need to write a Java class that extends the `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.UDF` class. This class will contain the logic for your custom function. The sources provide a simple example that converts a string to lowercase:

    ```java
    package com.example.hive.udf;

    import org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.Description;
    import org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.UDF;

    @Description(
        name = "Simple UDF Example"
    )
    public final class MyLowerCase extends UDF {
        public String evaluate(final String word) {
            return word.toLowerCase();
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Package the Code into a JAR:** Compile your Java code and package it into a JAR file.

3.  **Add the JAR to Hive:** Use the `ADD JAR` command in Hive to make your JAR file available to the Hive session.

    ```sql
    ADD JAR /root/hivedemos/UpperCase.jar;
    ```

4.  **Create a Temporary Function:** Create a temporary function in Hive that maps to your Java UDF class. You can use the `CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION` statement for this purpose.

    ```sql
    CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION touppercase AS 'com.example.hive.udf.MyUpperCase'; 
    ```

    This statement creates a temporary function named `touppercase` that points to your `MyUpperCase` UDF.

5.  **Use the UDF in Queries:** You can now use your UDF in Hive queries just like any other built-in function.

    ```sql
    SELECT TOUPPERCASE(name) FROM STUDENT;
    ```

# Types of UDFs

Hive supports different types of UDFs, each suited for particular tasks:

*   **UDF (Regular UDF):**  Operates on a single row and returns a single value. The example in the sources demonstrates a regular UDF.
*   **UDAF (User-Defined Aggregate Function):** Operates on multiple rows and returns a single aggregated value, similar to built-in aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, or `COUNT`.
*   **UDTF (User-Defined Table-Generating Function):**  Takes a single row as input and outputs multiple rows, effectively expanding the input row into a table.

### Benefits of UDFs

*   **Extensibility:** UDFs allow you to extend Hive's functionality with custom logic, tailored to your specific data processing needs.
*   **Code Reusability:** You can package and reuse your UDFs across different Hive projects and scripts.
*   **Improved Performance:** In some cases, UDFs can be more performant than equivalent logic implemented using HiveQL alone, especially for complex operations.

### Key Considerations

*   **Language:** Hive UDFs are typically written in Java, requiring familiarity with Java programming.
*   **Performance Impact:**  UDFs introduce additional processing steps. Carefully consider the performance implications, especially when dealing with large datasets.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test your UDFs to ensure they produce the expected results and handle different input scenarios correctly.

UDFs are a powerful feature in Hive, enabling you to customise and enhance its data processing capabilities.

# Q. Create the following using HQL:
# i. Create a database
# ii. Create a relation Employee (EID, FName, LName, DOB,Salary, Address) with DB properties
# iii. Create a static partition on the above relation based on salary.

## Creating a Database, Relation, and Static Partition in Hive

Here's how you can create the requested elements using HiveQL (HQL):

### i. Create a Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS EmployeeDB 
COMMENT 'Database for Employee information' 
WITH DBPROPERTIES ('creator' = 'Your Name', 'created_date' = '2023-12-19'); 
```

*   This statement creates a database named `EmployeeDB` if it doesn't already exist.
*   The `COMMENT` clause adds a description to the database.
*   The `WITH DBPROPERTIES` clause allows you to set key-value pairs as properties for the database.

### ii. Create the Employee Relation

```sql
USE EmployeeDB; -- Switch to the EmployeeDB database

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employee (
    EID INT,
    FName STRING,
    LName STRING,
    DOB DATE,
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2), 
    Address STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'; 
```

*   The `USE` statement switches the current database context to `EmployeeDB`.
*   This `CREATE TABLE` statement creates a table named `Employee` if it doesn't exist.
*   The table includes columns for `EID`, `FName`, `LName`, `DOB`, `Salary`, and `Address`, with their respective data types.
*   `DECIMAL(10,2)` defines `Salary` as a decimal type with 10 digits of precision and 2 decimal places.
*   `ROW FORMAT DELIMITED` specifies the format of the data rows, and `FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'` indicates that fields are separated by tabs.

### iii. Create a Static Partition based on Salary

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employee_Partitioned (
    EID INT,
    FName STRING,
    LName STRING,
    DOB DATE,
    Address STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (Salary DECIMAL(10,2))
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'; 

-- Load data into the partitioned table
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE Employee_Partitioned PARTITION (Salary=30000)
SELECT EID, FName, LName, DOB, Address FROM Employee WHERE Salary = 30000;
```

*   This `CREATE TABLE` statement creates a table named `Employee_Partitioned`, similar to the previous `Employee` table but with a partitioning clause.
*   `PARTITIONED BY (Salary DECIMAL(10,2))` defines a static partition on the `Salary` column.
*   The `INSERT OVERWRITE` statement loads data into a specific partition (`Salary=30000`). You would need to repeat this for other salary values you want to partition by.

**Note:** The specific methods for loading data into tables are covered in the sources. You can use `LOAD DATA` commands to import data from files in different formats. 

Remember to adapt these HQL statements based on your specific data file locations and the salary values you want to use for partitioning.

## Creating the University Database and Related Structures in Hive

This response will walk you through the steps of creating a University database, a Student relation, and partitions and buckets within Hive, using HQL based on the provided sources. 

### i. Create the University Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS University 
COMMENT 'Database for University student information' 
WITH DBPROPERTIES ('creator' = 'Your Name', 'created_date' = '2023-12-19'); 
```

This statement will create a database named `University` if it doesn't already exist. It will include a comment describing the database and set database properties for the creator and creation date. 

### ii. Create the Student Schema

```sql
USE University;  -- Switch to the University database

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Student (
    Sid INT,
    name STRING, 
    branch STRING,
    CGPA FLOAT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'; 
```

The `USE` statement switches the active database to `University`. The `CREATE TABLE` statement will then create a table called `Student` with the specified columns and data types. Note that `chararray` is referred to as `STRING` in the sources. The `ROW FORMAT` clause defines the data structure.

### iii. Load Data into the Table

The sources describe using the `LOAD DATA` statement to load data from files into Hive tables. Here's a general example:

```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/path/to/your/student_data.tsv' 
OVERWRITE INTO TABLE Student;
```

*   Replace `/path/to/your/student_data.tsv` with the actual path to your data file.
*   `LOCAL` indicates that the file is on the local file system. If the file is in HDFS, remove `LOCAL`.
*   `OVERWRITE` will replace any existing data in the `Student` table with the data from the file. 

You can find more detailed explanations and variations of the `LOAD DATA` statement in the sources.

### iv. Create a Static Partition Based on CGPA

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Student_Partitioned (
    Sid INT,
    name STRING,
    branch STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (CGPA FLOAT)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'; 

-- Load data into a specific partition (e.g., CGPA = 7.5)
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE Student_Partitioned PARTITION (CGPA=7.5)
SELECT Sid, name, branch FROM Student WHERE CGPA = 7.5;
```

This creates a partitioned table `Student_Partitioned` and then loads data into a partition where `CGPA = 7.5`. You would need to repeat the `INSERT OVERWRITE` statement for each CGPA value you want to partition by. 

Static partitions require manual specification of partition values.

### v. Create a Bucketed Table 

```sql
-- Enable bucketing 
SET hive.enforce.bucketing=true;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Student_Bucketed (
    Sid INT,
    name STRING, 
    branch STRING,
    CGPA FLOAT
)
CLUSTERED BY (CGPA) INTO 3 BUCKETS
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'; 

-- Load data into the bucketed table 
FROM Student
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE Student_Bucketed 
SELECT Sid, name, branch, CGPA;
```

This code first enables bucketing and then creates a table `Student_Bucketed`. The `CLUSTERED BY` clause, with `INTO 3 BUCKETS`, defines the bucketing configuration. The data is then loaded from the `Student` table into the bucketed table. 

Bucketing is used to group data based on a hash function applied to the specified column (`CGPA` in this case). This can improve performance for certain queries. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

| **Bucket**           | `CREATE TABLE ... CLUSTERED BY`             | Creates a bucketed table. Bucketing uses a hash function to distribute data into a fixed number of buckets (files) within each partition, potentially improving performance for certain queries.                                                                                    | `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS student_bucketed (rollno int,name string, grade float) CLUSTERED BY (grade) into 3 buckets;`                                                                                                   |      |
| **View**             | `CREATE VIEW`                              | Creates a view, a virtual table representing a saved query. Views don't store data physically.                                                                                                                                                                                         | `CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS SELECT EID, FName, LName FROM Employee WHERE Salary > 60000;`                                                                                                                                |           |
|                       | `DROP VIEW`                               | Deletes a view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `DROP VIEW EmployeeView;`                                                                                                                                                                                                          |           |
| **Index**            | `CREATE INDEX`                              | **Not commonly used in Hive.** Indexes in traditional databases speed up data retrieval but are less effective in the context of Hadoop's large-scale data processing. Hive primarily relies on partitioning and bucketing for performance optimization. Consider these before indexing. | `CREATE INDEX employee_index ON TABLE Employee (EID) AS 'compact';`                                                                                                                                                     |           |

### Function Commands

Hive provides a wide range of built-in functions for data manipulation, aggregation, string handling, date and time operations, and more. You can also create User-Defined Functions (UDFs) to extend Hive's functionality.

**Common Function Categories:**

*   **Aggregation:** `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`, `STDDEV`, `VARIANCE`, etc.
*   **String:** `CONCAT`, `SUBSTR`, `LENGTH`, `LOWER`, `UPPER`, `TRIM`, `REGEX_EXTRACT`, etc.
*   **Date/Time:** `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND`, `DATE_ADD`, `DATE_DIFF`, etc.
*   **Mathematical:** `ROUND`, `FLOOR`, `CEIL`, `ABS`, `POWER`, etc.
*   **Conditional:** `IF`, `CASE`, `COALESCE`, `NULLIF`, etc.
*   **Collection:** `SIZE`, `MAP_KEYS`, `ARRAY_CONTAINS`, etc.
*   **Type Conversion:** `CAST`, `CONVERT`, etc.
*   **User-Defined Functions (UDFs):** Allow extending Hive with custom logic written in Java or other supported languages.

**Example Function Usages:**

```sql
SELECT AVG(gpa) FROM student;
SELECT CONCAT(FName, ' ', LName) AS FullName FROM Employee;
SELECT YEAR(DOB) AS BirthYear FROM Employee;
```
