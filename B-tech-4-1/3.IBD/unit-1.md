# Structured data

##  Structured Data: Organised and Relational 

Structured data is characterised by its **high degree of organisation**. This data conforms to a predefined schema or model, which makes it easily understood and processed by computer programs.  The sources primarily use **relational databases (RDBMS)** as an example of how structured data is stored and managed. RDBMS are based on the relational model, where data is represented in tables, consisting of rows (also called records or tuples) and columns (also called attributes or fields).

### Defining Structure

The structure of a relational database is determined by its **schema**, which defines the tables, columns, data types, and constraints for the data.  Here's how the schema contributes to the structured nature of the data:

* **Data Types**: Each column is assigned a specific data type, such as integer, varchar (text), date, Boolean, etc., which dictates the kind of data that can be stored in that column.
* **Data Length**:  The schema specifies the maximum length for text data types, ensuring consistency in data storage.
* **Constraints**:  The schema includes various constraints to ensure data integrity and validity. For example, 
    * **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table, ensuring that there are no duplicate records.
    * **Foreign Key**: Establishes relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table, ensuring referential integrity.
    * **UNIQUE**:  Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
    * **NOT NULL**:  Specifies that a column cannot have empty values.
    * **Business Constraints**: Custom rules can be enforced, such as ensuring a salary value does not fall below a minimum threshold.

### Working with Structured Data

The structured nature of data in RDBMS offers several advantages:

* **Ease of Manipulation**:  Structured Query Language (SQL) allows users to easily insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from RDBMS.

### iii. Symmetric Multiprocessor Systems (SMP)

Symmetric Multiprocessor Systems (SMP) represent a tightly coupled multiprocessor architecture where two or more identical processors share a single common main memory. This means each processor has complete access to all input/output (I/O) devices and operates under the control of a single operating system. 

To visualize this, imagine a team working on a project where everyone has equal access to the same resources and information. SMP functions in a similar way, allowing processors to collaborate seamlessly and share the workload efficiently.

Each processor in an SMP system also has its own high-speed memory called cache memory, connected through a system bus. This architecture enhances processing efficiency by providing processors with quick access to frequently used data.

While the sources do not explicitly contrast SMP with Massively Parallel Processing (MPP), they do provide a definition of MPP. In an MPP system, each processor has its own dedicated memory and operating system, and they communicate through a messaging interface.  The sources also note that MPP systems can be more challenging to program because the application needs to be divided in a way that allows all the executing segments to communicate effectively.

| **Fault Tolerance**   | Less fault tolerant, as a failure in one processor can affect the entire system                               | More fault tolerant, as a failure in one machine typically does not affect others                                                                                |
| **Complexity**       | Simpler to program and manage due to the shared memory and single operating system                     | More complex to program and manage due to the need for coordination and communication between independent machines                                          |
| **Application**      | Suitable for tasks that require high processing power and low latency, such as scientific computing        | Ideal for tasks that involve large amounts of data and can be parallelized, such as web search, online transactions, and big data processing                       |
| **Shared Resources** | Processors share resources like memory and I/O devices                                                 | Machines may share some resources, like storage, but typically have their own dedicated resources, such as memory and processing power                          |
| **Data Consistency**  | Easier to maintain data consistency due to the shared memory architecture                                 | More challenging to maintain data consistency due to the distributed nature of data, often relying on mechanisms like eventual consistency to ensure data integrity over time |
